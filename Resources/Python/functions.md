## len()
len is a function that takes an object as an argument and returns the length.
```python
list = ["beans","toast","knife","england"]
tuple = {"eggs","sausage"}

print(len(list))
print(len(tuple))

# this would return 4,2
```
The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set)
*** 
## .copy()
**Python List Copy() methods**Â return a shallow copy of a list. A shallow copy of a list is a list that shares the same memory location as the old list meaning functions like **append** and and **pop** will apply to both the copy and the new function.

## .deepcopy()
Deep copy creates a deep copy of the list meaning it is stored in a new memory location diffrent from the shallow copy.

```python
list =[1,2,3]
shallowCopy = list.copy()
deepCopy = list.deepcopy()

list.append(4)

print(f"deep:{deepCopy} shallow: {shallowCopy}")
# OUTPUT:
# deep:[1,2,3] shallow: [1,2,3,4]
```
notice how when appending to the original it also effects the shallow copy while the deep copy remains uneffected this is a result of the change in memory location.
