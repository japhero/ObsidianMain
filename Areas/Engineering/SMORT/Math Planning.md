- we need to calculate in the loss of fuel mass as the rocket is launched to change the effect on the rocket's velocity and eventual position

- Innital rocket vector is defined as $\vec{V} = v$
- $\hat{i}$ is a [[unit vector]] in the x direction
- Measured relative with [[Frames of reference|respect ]] to earth
- the mass decreases by $dm$
- gass exit velocity $(v-u)\hat i$
- mass decreases by $dm_g$  and velocity decreases by $dv\hat i$
