- we need to calculate in the loss of fuel mass as the rocket is launched to change the effect on the rocket's velocity and eventual position

- Innital rocket vector is defined as $\vec{V} = v$
- $\hat{i}$ is a [[unit vector]] in the x direction
- Measured relative with [[Frames of reference|respect ]] to earth
- the mass decreases by $dm$
- gass exit velocity $(v-u)\hat i$
- mass decreases by $dm_g$  and velocity decreases by $dv\hat i$ 

 
 

  # [wiki Dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion)
-  $$ d = \frac{v^2 \cos(\theta)}{g} \left( v \sin{\theta} +  \sqrt{ v^2 \sin^2({\theta}) +2gy_{0} } \right) $$
  
  
# Program ideas
for the final we can use matplot lib for projected path and then use a CSV file to get the actuall path similar to a basic velecity trajectory $\downarrow$

- Dont make it to complicated just use it for documentation and to learn the math for the actual calculation
