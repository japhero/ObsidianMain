- Road Runner is the math behind odometry and then applying that These systems then use  
- Is FTC using drive encoders YES
- if we aren't we apply feed forward encoders tuner that estimates the voltage to distance calculation instead of [[PID]]. 
- what's **the follower PID?**
- Drive constants has everything on the physical characteristics of the robot. Mechanum wheel 
- Dead wheel is a 3ird wheel that gets data for [[odometry]]
