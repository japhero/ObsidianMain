The idea of the course is to introduce 20342's coders into coding with FTC 

## First Lecture: Theory 
- Go through lecture assumptions eg basic java some coding experience 
- Object Oriented programming 
	- Make them each come up with a way to assign objects to their robot. 
	- Talk about interfaces between Object oriented programing 
- Encapsulation 
	- Why it protects good code from bad code 
	- How Encapsulation helps with FTC and what our plan is for continuing to reuse code
- Java syntax for OOP
	- interface
	- Classess
	- Inheritance
- Overview slide talking about what we learned about and Q&A
- HW: 
	- Make the students create a object oriented desgin for their robot and the interfaces 

## Second Lecture: 7080's FTC codebase 

- Talk about the different type of op-modes 


**Material Planning**
- create a class diagram 
- Create an interface diagram
