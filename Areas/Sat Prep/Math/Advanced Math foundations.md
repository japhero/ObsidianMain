## Using the Discriminant to find out how many solutions there are to a given Quadratic 
The discriminant is part of the quadratic formula, it using the standard form of the quadratic equation $(ax^2+bx+c)$ lets us determine how many solutions there are to a given Quadratic. 

The discriminant is although still an equation that being 
$$\large{ b^2-4ac }$$ To determine how many solutions there are we simply take the coefficients of a quadratic in its standard form and solve; the value we get represents how many real solutions we have. To figure it out consult the table below ^2a6bc0

| Discriminant    | `#` of solutions  |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Positive Number | Two solutions     |
| Zero            | One real solution |
| Negative number | No solutions      |

### Solving for certain outcomes
Sometimes we are asked to solve for the coefficients of a Quadratic so that they give us a certain outcome. For example you could be given the equation $kx^2+5x+7$  and asked to solve for $k$ so that the quadratic has one solution.
We can do this by taking the discriminant and plugging in $k$ for $a$ and solving for $k$ after we set the equation equal to zero, we can do this as we know when the [[#^2a6bc0|Discriminant]] is equal to zero we have 1 solution.

**Radicals and rational exponents** 
- use  [[Exponent Rules]]
- Basicaly use the exponent rules and algebra to solve exponent problems eg if $2x-3y=4$ what does $\frac{4^x}{8^y}$ equal. (hard question)

 **Operation with polynomials** 
- can only add like terms (follow general algebra rules PEMDAS)
- Multiply polynomials using FOIL

==**Operations with rational expressions**==
- Algebraic long devision is a way to create identities of rational expressions. 
- **Dividing fractions review**
	- when dividing fractions you multiply by the reciprocal eg $\frac{a}{\left( \frac{b}{c} \right)}=\frac{a}{1} \cdot \frac{c}{b}$
**Isolating quantities**
- to get rid of an exponent eg $(x^2+1)^t$  raise it to its inverse
**Solving quadratic equations**
- [[Quadratic Formula]]
- $$x=\frac{{b \pm \sqrt{ b^2-4ac }}}{2a}$$
- simplifying radicals 
	- can separate the inside of the radical and then distribute the radical 
	- eg
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\sqrt{ 84 } \\
\sqrt{ 21*4 } \\
\sqrt{ 21 } \cdot \sqrt{ 4 } \\
\sqrt{ 84 }= 2\sqrt{ 21 }
\end{array}
$$
**Linear and quadratic systems**
- [[Systems of equations]] for linear equations 

## Word problems 
- Exponential functions 
	- Population
$$
P(t)= P_{0} r^t
$$
$$
\text{innital population}\cdot (\text{rate})^{\text{time}}
$$
	- Compounding intrest
$$
P(t)=P_{0}(1+r)^t
$$
- difference is that rate is a percentage increase of the exponential function

## systems of EQ
$$
\begin{array}{l}
y=5kx^2 +2x+3 \\
\frac{y}{10}=-x
\end{array}
$$
if k is a positive constant what is the value of k

you can use the determinant in the [[Quadratic Formula]] to see how many solutions it will have
