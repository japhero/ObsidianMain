- to get a slope perpendicular to the one given get the inverse reciprocal. Example $\frac{4}{5}x \to -\frac{5}{4}x$ 
- No solution in the context of systems of equations is when both equations dont intersect when graphed typicaly seen with parallell lines.


## Absolute value

- ususally have 2 solutions
- plug in the values given int o desmos or into the fucntion and then just solve to see if the answer is correct
- Do the old $y=a$ trick to find were a function equals a value
- **to solve algebraically for the 2 values just set quantity under the absolute value to a negative and solve and then to a postive and solve this will solve for both answers**
- when it gives you an absolute value equation and then says what is the positive/negative value of another equation its asking you to solve the absolute value equation then use the positive or negative value found when solving and then substitute for x.
	- EXAMPLE: If $\mid x-5\mid =20$ what's the negative value of $x+5$?
	- Solve for the negative value and then substituite into $x+5$


## Core Math
Basically math word problems

Have to be able to do 3 things
- Evaluate Sample
- Draw conclusions from the data
- Describe the margin of error
- Give a summary


### Evaluate
We can use different criteria to evaluate if the sample is good it has to be 
- **Random**
- **Representative**
we can use that criteria to evaluate if the sample is good
### Margin of Error
SAT, questions will not ask us to figure out the value of a margin of error. Instead, they will ask us to interpret a given margin of error.
  $(Value \space \pm \space Error)$

TRICKS
- Note we can only generalize for the sample taken 
- Sample size is almost never the problem 

### Inequalities 
- when dividing or multiplying by a negative number on both sides you have to flip the inequality 
- inequalities represent a range of numbers



## statistics 

### Standard deviation 
Standard deviation measures the _typical spread_ from the mean; it is the average distance between the mean and a value in the data set.
- sat wont ask you to calculate the standard deviation
- 

### Mode
the mode of an equation is the value with the most occurrences. 


### Calculate a missing value using the mean 
1. calculate the sum of values by multiplying the mean by the number of values 
2. Subtract all know values from the sum of values.


# [[Factoring polynomials]]

### Formulas 
$a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2$
$a^2-2ab+b^2=(a-b)^2$
$a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$
