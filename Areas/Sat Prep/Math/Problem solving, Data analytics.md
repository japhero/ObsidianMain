## Ratios rates and proportions 


# Ratios 

 It helps to write out the relationships when given rates/ratios because we always know that 2 ratios will always be the same if you are using it as a baseline.

> [!EXAMPLE]- EXAMPLE: How far did Jim drive if he drove at 45 miles per hour for 2 and a half hours.
> 
> You start by writing out the given rate:
>  $$
> \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}= \frac{45}{1}
> $$
> Because we know that the ratio of speed over time will be the same for both scenarios we can equate them. But because we dont know the distance traveled we have to use $x$ to represent the distance 
> $$
> \frac{45}{1}=\frac{x}{2.5}
> $$
> Now all we have to do is solve for $x$ (the distance)
> $$
> \begin{array}{ll}
> \frac{45}{1}=\frac{x}{2.5} \\
> x=45 \cdot 2.5 \\
> \color{orange} x= 112.5
> \end{array}
> $$

- Remember to double check the wording of a cirtain question offten it will try  to confuse you by giving you a dataset but requiring manipulation to figure out the wanted rate.
	- For example if you have total people and people with the flu if could ask you for people without the flu over people with the flu. 

- Also after answering every question it makes sense to a **"sanity check"**, meaning you just go over the answer and make sure that it logically follows for example if my car has a mpg of $23$ and i have $3$ gallons of gas it doesn't make sense for me to have a max range of $5$ miles.



## Distributions  (Center, spread, and shape)
- What are summary statistics 
- Ways to concisely describe data 


**Median**
Middle value

**Mean**
average value

**Standard deviation** 
Standard deviation measures the _typical spread_ from the mean; it is the average distance between the mean and a value in the data set.

**Mode**
the mode of an equation is the value with the most occurrences. 

**Calculate a missing value using the mean** 
1. calculate the sum of values by multiplying the mean by the number of values 
2. Subtract all know values from the sum of values.

- Generally these will try to confuse you by writing charts based on occurrence not on number changing the standard deviation from large to small.

## Data representations 
- Create/interprit data given either a representation or data

**Representations**
- Bar chart
- Histogram
- Dot plot
- Line graph


## Scatterplots 


### Approximating line of best fit
To approximate the slope of the line simply take 2 points that are close to an approximation for the line of best fit and use them as inputs for the slope.
$$
m = \frac{r_{2}-r_{1}}{a_{2}-a_{1}}
$$
You can usually find these by drawing what looks like the line of best fit

## Linear and Exponential Growth

Exponential functions 
- Population
$$
P(t)= P_{0} r^t
$$
$$
\text{innital population}\cdot (\text{rate})^{\text{time}}
$$
	- Compounding intrest
$$
P(t)=P_{0}(1+r)^t
$$
- difference is that rate is a percentage increase of the exponential function
- Exponential functions increase as a percentage of the function were as linear functions increase at a set rate or "slope". For example a linear function increases by 5 over every interval whereas

## Probability and relative frequency
- When looking at data tables the key to solving the question is always to hone in on what the question is asking. To do this try and figure out the parts of the problem
