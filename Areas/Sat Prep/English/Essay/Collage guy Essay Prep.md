Wrong, I shouted the room eerily quiet after I had done so, the long shadow of my brother's face wincing at the sound of my voice clearly frustrated, at this point in the conversation we had both stopped caring about who was right, only really trying to convince ourselves that the other was wrong. I probably would have told you that 1+1 = 3 had it meant that I was considered the winner, a kind of Olympic gold medal for stubbornness. 

My argumentation really started out of my interest in politics as although my parents couldn't vote they had no problem sharing their opinion. Even at 12 I would argue with my parents confidently clueless I was still determined to learn more even through frustrating conversations. Eating my food during dinner, the next thought, the next idea ready floated in my head ready to be presented ready to be questioned. Over time this loop made me realize that its the round table, the exchange of ideas that matters most not necessarily if I'm talking politics, life or work will I find the best idea or thought the first time I hear it, being flexible and listening really made me embrace that it didn't matter what specific idea I was talking about as long as the formula was right.

Now when my English teacher asks me what Salinger meant in Catcher in the Rye or when my government teacher asks why we should have the right to free speech I hope to answer not because I know I'm right but because I want to find out, and although I might sometimes be stubborn I hope that sometimes I might get close and I hope that more people care about the process of conversation rather than focusing on the product.

# What would i say if i was talking at a podcast 
i think that arguing is a way that i can understand people and that even though arguing can often be seen as aggressive and rude i think that if you engage in arguing in a healthy way and ground yourself out in fundamental ideas and values that projecting those into your arguments can have a profound impact on understanding yourself and trying to figure out what your values are along with the benefit of having a good foundation for the ideas that you learn in the future.
