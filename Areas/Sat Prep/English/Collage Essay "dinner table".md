## [Sample essays from NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/16/your-money/college-essays-money.html)

- Uses mundane objects as symbols possibly in an allegory or analogy
	- cockroach is the mundane object in  essay 2
- Opens with a descriptive sentence and describes an environment

**Essay 2**
- Why does he use the third person?
- Uses irony to fight a stereotype i guess money men not typically asosicatd with eating cockroaches for 10$.
- Personal trauma expands on the idea of money man
- changes the meaning of money man and the concept this essay does a good job of explaining a perspective specifically about "money men"
- Good way to transition into yourself after giving an ancedote.
-  Money man -> cockroach man VERY GOOD word play and anagly very effectively "Hammers home"

**Essay 3**
- Expo has descriptive story
- coins are incorporated very well 
	- The lottery ticket was finding a rare coin
- Natural feeling language narration
- what do the coins mean in the sense whats the message?
- Definitely a more abstract essay that proves that abstraction is possible to achieve goals although, i dont want to use it.

**Essay 4**
- Descriptive, flowery
- Poem style but definitly unique writing
- weath is exasterbated 
- Her driving is explicity used to describe how she asks questions.
- AMAZING HAMMER
	- "The chaos, injustice and joy of the roads of Phnom Penh have fundamentally made me who I am, and I will only continue to grow as I leave them. As I pull into the parking lot, I know that my education has started far before the bell has rung."


**Inspiration and Notes **
- these are made better because as said they are each distinct and not over the top although 4 maby a tiny bit. 
- Each has a very very very good finisher.

# ESSAY

## structure

		- potential Quotes
			- "All perception is coloured by emotion. - Kant"
	- ancedote/stories (could be several target is 1/3 of essay)
	- Connection to my values 
	- Hammer home/finisher


## Intro

- Do i want to start with an example that is me arguing about somthing stupid or important 
	- Stupid
		- Alows me to add nuance to the fact that not all ideas are important or that we dont allways need to be talking about seruous ideas
	- Serious
		- Lets me make my point in an obviously direct way 
		- more corny and cliche 

**Possible Anecdotes**
- Arguing about my brother not cleaning
- Going to my brother to argue with him
- Online politics 


1. 
That doesn't make any sense I yelled while reaching for the rice my Brother grimacing in my direction appearing annoyed as I continued my tirade lecturing him on how he should have been more timely with his efforts to clean up after himself. My other brother clearly only interested with the food in his mouth although similarly annoyed interrupted me to tell me how dumb I sounded. 

After dinner i continued rambling although not as i had before, walking up the stairs flipping my phone in my hand and the thoughts in my head, was i right?, maybe what i said was unfair. 

At the top of the stairs i had allready made up my mind it was irrelevant. 

2. 
That doesn't make any sense I yelled chowing down on my food after  "explaining" to my brother why our education system was in a horrble place 


## Connection 

Growing up this combative dining experience was all to common as my parents had taken a lassie fair approach to our conversations and tried to have us find the "right ideas" rather than spoon feed them to us. The "invisible hand" can take you anywhere but really made me thirsty for more.


## Hammer

I want collage to help me quench my thirst, i hope that a new table brings new ideas and i hope that i can
