Pronoun-antecedent agreement is a convention of Standard English that requires a [[English Concept definitons#Pronouns|pronouns]] and [[English Concept definitons#Antecedent|antecedent]] to agree in person and number.

	- When they are using complex sentances therefore when observing large distance between pronoun and antecedent use caution.
	- Sometimes ironically the antecedent can be found before the noun making it difficult to spot what noun the antecedent is referring to  

**Tips**
- Find the antecedent.
- You can also plug in the antecedent for the pronoun to check if it makes sense also checking the validity of the antecedent.

# Plurals and Possessives
**Plurals** are nouns and pronouns that refer to more than one thing.

**Possessives** are nouns and pronouns that show possession.

- Plurals and Possessives can be similar and often cause confusion especially when choosing to use apostrophes.

**Things to remember** 
- **Plural nouns** don't use apostrophes. (Ex The **Plants** in the greenhouse are thriving.)
- **Singular possessive** nouns require an apostrophe followed by an s. (Ex The **Company's** most popular products include shampoo and moisturizer) 
- **Plural possessive nouns** that end in "s" require an apostrophe after the "s". (Ex On many superhero teams, the **heroes'** costumes are each a different color.) if it doesn't end in s the s comes before the apostrophe.  
- **Pronouns** never use apostrophes. (Ex **his** favorite food is the same as **hers**)


- **Look for errors with genitives and plurals if** 
	- the choices add or remove apostrophes 
	- the choices change the placement of apostrophes 

Difference between possessive and non possessive nouns 
- possessive nouns are the same as normal nouns just they use an apostrophe to indicate possestion
- Note that possesive nouns indicate that that noun is the owner for example **Jeremy's** car, the apostrophe after jeremy indicates that he is the owner of the car. 


### When is it a plural or possessives question? 
Plurals and possessives questions can be identified most commonly when you see the answer choices change the use of an apostrophe. 


![[Plurals and possessives example|700]]


**Examples**

> [!EXAMPLE]-  Slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo’s debut novel The Poet X, winner of the 2018 National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, is composed of ----- protagonist, fifteen-year-old Xiomara Batista.
> a. poem’s putatively written by the novel’s
> b. poem’s putatively written by the novels’
> c. poems putatively written by the novels’
> d. ==poems putatively written by the novel’s==
> D is the correct answer because as seen in the sentence the plural noun poems doesn't have possession over anything although the singular noun novel has possession therefore requiring it to have an apostrophe "s".
