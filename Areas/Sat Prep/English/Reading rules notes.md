# Dump
- Sentence must have a verb and a subject
- A Question asks for information.

## Subjects
- Usually a noun or pronoun (dog,tree,Mya)
- Some traditional verbs can be nouns for example "Soccer is my favorite sport." soccer is a noun because it refers to an act so it functions as a noun.
- The main subject of a sentence must have a "main verb".
- "ing" and "to" verbs cant be the "main" verb.

# [Pronoun-antecedent agreement](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat-reading-and-writing/x0d47bcec73eb6c4b:digital-sat-grammar-practice/x0d47bcec73eb6c4b:fss-pronoun-antecedent-agreement/a/fss-grammar-guide-pronoun-antecedent-agreement) 
Pronoun-antecedent agreement is a convention of Standard English that requires a [[English Concept definitons#Pronouns|pronouns]] and [[English Concept definitons#Antecedent|antecedent]] to agree in person and number.
- Makes sure that the pronoun so he, she, they or them matches up with the noun.
- You know its looking for [Pronoun-antecedent agreement](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat-reading-and-writing/x0d47bcec73eb6c4b:digital-sat-grammar-practice/x0d47bcec73eb6c4b:fss-pronoun-antecedent-agreement/a/fss-grammar-guide-pronoun-antecedent-agreement)  when it changes the number of the pronoun. This for instance would be true if one pronoun is singular such as "it" and another was plural like "they"
- a pronoun outside the blank refers to a noun contained within the choices
- **What makes them dificult to spot**
	- When they are using complex sentances therefore when observing large distance between pronoun and antecedent use caution.
	- Sometimes ironically the antecedent can be found before the noun making it difficult to spot what noun the antecedent is referring to  

**Tips**
- Find the antecedent.
- You can also plug in the antecedent for the pronoun to check if it makes sense also checking the validity of the antecedent.

# Punctuation

### Commas

Commas can:
- List items
- Seperate non essentials
- link dependent clauses to independant clauses 
- link independant clauses with FANBOYS conjunction
Cant:
- Split a subject and a verb
- Come before prepositions
- cant punctuate a 2 item list

### Semi Colons ;

can
- link independant clauses without a conjunction
- Seperate items in a complex list


### Colons :

can:
- Only follow independant clauses
- can introduce extra information and info
- introduce lists

### Dashes --
- set off nonessential information


## Strategies
- Check what type of clause or phrase the sentances before and after are.
- eliminate choices that result in errors

# Plurals and Possessives
**Plurals** are nouns and pronouns that refer to more than one thing.

**Possessives** are nouns and pronouns that show possession.

- Plurals and Possessives can be similar and often cause confusion especially when choosing to use apostrophes.

**Things to remember** 
- **Plural nouns** don't use apostrophes. (Ex The **Plants** in the greenhouse are thriving.)
- **Singular possessive** nouns require an apostrophe followed by an s. (Ex The **Company's** most popular products include shampoo and moisturizer) 
- **Plural possessive nouns** that end in "s" require an apostrophe after the "s". (Ex On many superhero teams, the **heroes'** costumes are each a different color.) if it doesn't end in s the s comes before the apostrophe.  
- **Pronouns** never use apostrophes. (Ex **his** favorite food is the same as **hers**)


- **Look for errors with genitives and plurals if** 
	- the choices add or remove apostrophes 
	- the choices change the placement of apostrophes 

Difference between possessive and non possessive nouns 
- possessive nouns are the same as normal nouns just they use an apostrophe to indicate possestion
- Note that possesive nouns indicate that that noun is the owner for example **Jeremy's** car, the apostrophe after jeremy indicates that he is the owner of the car. 


### When is it a plural or possessives question? 
Plurals and possessives questions can be identified most commonly when you see the answer choices change the use of an apostrophe. 


![[Plurals and possessives example|700]]


**Examples**

> [!EXAMPLE]-  Slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo’s debut novel The Poet X, winner of the 2018 National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, is composed of ----- protagonist, fifteen-year-old Xiomara Batista.
> a. poem’s putatively written by the novel’s
> b. poem’s putatively written by the novels’
> c. poems putatively written by the novels’
> d. ==poems putatively written by the novel’s==
> D is the correct answer because as seen in the sentence the plural noun poems doesn't have possession over anything although the singular noun novel has possession therefore requiring it to have an apostrophe "s".

# Verb forms 

- You don't need to classify verbs for the sat.
- complex sentences can make it difficult to accurately identify the correct tense to use.
- Only simple verbs can function without helping verbs 
- The job of the test taker is to describe the most logical choice.

- Verb tense is a property describing if a verb is in the past present or future
- **Verb aspect** is a property describing the condition meaning is the action happening did it just finish or similar things. 
- Check the time and make sure that the tenses match.


**Tips**
- Use context clues such as dates times or other conjugated verbs to contextualize your answer. 
- Match the tense of other verbs in the same sentence as this *usually* stays consistent 
- General statements of fact use simple present tense (e.g., "the sky **is** blue"). This means that if there are no context clues present tense is likely the best way to go.

# Subject modifier placement
- This mainly deals with how subjects and modifiers are placed in conjunction with one another. 
- The main errors that can happen are when a modifier is placed so that it doesn't modify the correct noun giving causing the sentence to be incorrect and confusing.

How to identify
- when the choices are more than a few words this can often be a modifier.
- the choices rearrange words into different orders.

**Tips**
- Modifiers need to be placed next to the subjects, so double check that the subject is next to the modifier to identify the correct answer. 
- In the context of subject and modifier placement possessive nouns can  often be confusing, this is because they basically act as adjectives instead of the subject. For example in the phrase Paul's car the subject is the car not Paul and Paul simply is describing who owns the car functioning like an adjective. Sometimes we can trick our brain into thinking that Paul is the subject when in fact it is the car.



> [!EXAMPLE]- Having returned from the ocean to the stream where it was born, ___ after which its offspring start the cycle anew.
> 
> A. an adult salmon's life cycle ends when it spawns and dies,
> ==B. an adult salmon spawns and dies, completing its life cycle,==
> C. the spawning and death of an adult salmon complete its life cycle,
> D. the life cycle of an adult salmon is complete when it spawns and die,
> 
> B is the correct answer because the subject that is placed after the modifier is the adult salmon logically connecting the modifier to the subject.

# Linking Clauses

- Sat focuses on how the clauses are linked together (or separated).
- End punctuation is the easiest way to separate clause's.


## Ending punctuation

Ending punctuation has 2 rules

> [!INFO]- **1.** The punctuation must match the function of the sentence.
>  This means that the sentence cant function differently from the punctuation, for example it wouldn't make sense for me to say "Your bike looks nice?" because I'm not asking a question so i don't need a question mark. 

> [!info]- **2.** End punctuation can only be used to separate two independent clauses.
> This rule is pretty straight forward punctuation can only separate distinct sentences. 


## Coordination 

- Coordination is linking 2 independent clauses using a comma (,) or a coordinating conjunction/FANBOYS.

- Coordinating conjunction are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so or FANBOYS

## Subordination
- Subordination means linking 2 clauses by making one of them dependent.
