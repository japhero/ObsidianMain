## Question 11

Create a Formula that gives the perimeter of the function $\overline{AB}$ and then plug in the values given and check with the given area of 64. The formula would be $P=2(3\overline {AB} +  \overline{AB})$. Then we input each answer to guess and check.

- $\color{grey} \colorbox{yellow} {f(8) = 2(3*8+8)=64}$ 
- $f(16) = 2(3*16+16) = 128$
- $f(32) = 2(3*32+32) = 256$
- $f(24) = 2(3*24+24) = 192$

Generally when given a problem were the result of the equation is linear such as this one($8x$ simplified). When we know the equation is linear we can assume that inputs greater will give a greater result meaning. This means that if we start with the median value we and we get a result thats larger than what we are looking for we can assume that all values greater are wrong. For this equation if we started with $16$ we would get $128$ as a result, this allows us to remove 24 and 32 as possibilities.

## Question 19
The longest side of right triangle $ABC$ is opposite angle $B$. If $\sin (A) =\frac{9}{41}$ whats the value of $\sin (C)$?

To solve this question we have to remember the rules of **SOCATOA**, but more specifically $\sin= \frac{opponsite}{hypotenuse}$ and $\cos = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$. We also have to remember the formula for a right triangle $a^2+b^2=c^2$.  To get started we have to realize that when it says "The longest side of right triangle $ABC$ is opposite angle $B$" it means 2 things 
1. $b$ is the longest side because the largest angle corresponds to the longest side also know as the hypotenuse in a right triangle.
2. $B$ is $90\degree$ because the largest angle in a right triangle is always $90 \degree$.

![[SAT prep question 19]]
First we know we have the hypotenuse:41 and one side $A:9$ . This means we can plug this into the formula for a right triangle $9^2+c^2+41^2$ and solve for x getting 40. Now that we have the opposite and hypotenuse side for c we know the answer $\frac{40}{41}$.
