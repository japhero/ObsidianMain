# My code notes and planning


## First Concept
Overall my first idea was to use a system of values were we use max and min to caclutate the sum then subtract 2 of each value under the max or if its negative but that doesnt work becasue some can have more than 2 and it doesnt have to all of the numbers less than the max value.

## Implemented Idea
My second idea is to use a hashMap as i know this is the right data structure to use. As is was listed under  hash in NeetCode.  The aproach is to whenever a number is found add that number to the "duplicates" and then in the future if that number is found again remove that number from the list and if the list is empty at the end were good. This works nice theoreticaly because it solves numbers with more than 3 of that int. Also it works nice as we can avoid solving for false.

* ### Problems Found
	* If we get a third value we are going to add back to the list unless we can compare indexes and make sure we only add to the list on first interation of that value. Ths problem was Solved by just making sure that the index of the N wasnt the first time that number apears when appending.
	* I Read the prompt wrong i thought that every item has to have 2 but not the case making the [[#First Iteration]] Invalid
	* Time error on [[#Second Implementation]] presumably becasue we are using .index to check for first index. solution would be HashMap becasue its a faster data structure and would change time complexity from (N)<sup>2</sup> to (N).

### First Iteration

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        duplicatesList = []
        
        for I,N in enumerate(nums):
            if N not in duplicatesList and nums.index(N) == I:
                duplicatesList.append(N)    
            elif N in duplicatesList:
                duplicatesList.pop(duplicatesList.index(N))
        
        return True if not duplicatesList else False

print(\
    containsDuplicate([1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]), # True
    containsDuplicate([1,2,3,4]) # False
)
```

## Second Implementation

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        duplicatesList = []
        
        for I,N in enumerate(nums):
            if N not in duplicatesList and nums.index(N) == I:
                duplicatesList.append(N)    
            elif N in duplicatesList:
                return True
        return False

print(\
    containsDuplicate([1,1,2,3,4]), # True
    containsDuplicate([1,2,3,4]) # False
)
```

## Third Implementation

I dont wana fix time when i allready have  (N) HOW AM I GETTING (N)<sup>2</sup>
