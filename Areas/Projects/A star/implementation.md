The implementation of the algorithm was just applying the concept found in the [[A Star algorithm vid notes|notes page]]. Overview Its a demo for the algorithm.


# Code structure 
The code was split into 3 parts 
* [[#Node Class]] 
	*  The node Class is a container for all of the nodes 
* [[#Algorithm|Algorithm Function ]]
	* This function is the main function behind the application of the [[A Star algorithm vid notes|notes]]. It takes the inputs from the player generated by mainloop pauses updates and runs the "math" behind getting the result.
* [[#Mainloop]]
	* Main loop is responsible for using all of the functions and methods we have created. It sets up the grid checks for keyboard inputs and manages all objects. It also maintains the framrate and all display/Dimention objects.
