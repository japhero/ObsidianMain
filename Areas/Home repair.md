# Dryer 
- Dryer is returning the code for clogged duct when running the duct test. The duct is also clogged although the problem could be that the dryer is also experiencing a heating issue because of the clog.

After remove the clogged tube and letting the dryer push air freely the dryer test still returned a CLGed error
