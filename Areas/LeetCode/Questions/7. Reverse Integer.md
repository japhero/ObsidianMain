# Ideas 
- if i cant store anything greater than $2^{32}$ because its a 32 bit int how will i check the condition of being less than a 32 bits
- Assigned vs unassigned?
- We can use `%` to strip the numbers similar to in [[Ap Computer Science A]]


# Solution


## String cheat 
The first idea was to use strings to cheat as python can easily reverse strings and then restore the variable as a [[concepts#ints|int]] and return it. The conditional check for weather or not the [[concepts#ints|int]] is a 32 bit integer was done by getting the $\log_{2}(x)$  which would give us the bit number as to get the number of a certain bit you just do the exponent of $2$ to get that bit. For example to get the highest $16$ bit number do $2^{16}$. The base is $2$ because a bit has $2$ values true and false. Therefore to get the bit amount we do the inverse of an exponent a $\log$.

``` python
import math

class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        strVs = int(str(x)[::-1]) # Gets the inverse string as a int 
        return strVs if math.log2(strVs) <= 32  else 0 # Checks if the value 
													   # will be greater than 32
													   # bits.
 ```

# [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/) 
<div class="xFUwe" data-track-load="description_content"><p>Given a signed 32-bit integer <code>x</code>, return <code>x</code><em> with its digits reversed</em>. If reversing <code>x</code> causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range <code>[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]</code>, then return <code>0</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).</strong></p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> x = 123
<strong>Output:</strong> 321

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> x = -123
<strong>Output:</strong> -321

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> x = 120
