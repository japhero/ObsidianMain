# Adding up ASCII
The first iteration was based on the idea that adding up all the ASCII values of a string would give us a unique ID for any combination of the characters in that string because no matter in what order we added the letters of a string up they would have the same `strGVal` or "String group value". 

## In loop
In the loop, we would remove the current string from the original list and add to the `Final` or return value as a `[[str1],]` because we know that it has to be part of a group. Then we would take the value of that "group" and find all other strings with the same value, remove them and then put them into the corresponding Final list. We have to remove them because when we go into the next group, we don't want to create a new list for the same ASCII add up value.

## Adding up ASCII code
```python

class Solution:
    
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: list[str]) -> list[list[str]]:
        if len(strs) <= 1: 
            # Redundancy for empty or singular strings
            return [strs]  
        
        final = [] 
        # Creates the return Value

        for i, currString in enumerate(strs):
            strGVal = sum(ord(l) for l in currString ) 
            # Gets the ANCII Value for the current group
            
            final.append(list(currString)) #creats the group 
            
            strs.pop(i) # Removes the first value that created the group

            for otherString in strs.copy():
                otherValue = sum(ord(l) for l in otherString) 
                # Creates the ANCII addup for every iteration in Str

                if otherValue == strGVal: # checks if the group value and 
								          #iteration value are the same 
                    strs.remove(otherString) # if equal removes the value and 
								             # adds it to the group.
                    final[i].append(otherString)

        if strs != [] and strs is not None: # adds all singular groups groups 
									        # with no other anagrams.
            final.append(strs)

        return final 
        

solution = Solution()

print(solution.groupAnagrams(["","",""])) # TEst

> [!BUG]-
> One issue is that the program assumes that all strings will have the same length which turns out not to be true this causing smaller strings to add up to larger strings containing characters with lower values. 
>    
>  Example
>  - `"aaa" == "zs"`

> [!BUG]-
> Another issue is that the code is not completely efficient so that [[time complexity]] is at $O(n)$ because we can loop over values that are not in the current group and then do nothing with them wait for their group until we move them into final.

<div class="px-5 pt-4"><div class="flex"></div><div class="xFUwe" data-track-load="description_content"><p>Given an array of strings <code>strs</code>, group <strong>the anagrams</strong> together. You can return the answer in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>An <strong>Anagram</strong> is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.</p>
