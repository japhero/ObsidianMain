## `::` 
what does `::` do?
- Does it link the function defintion to the header in another file?
- `std::cout` links the cout comand to the std reference so i think it determins what file gets to define the header of the call 


## Bitwise operators 
- << is a shift operator similarly to other languages such as in python but why is it for example used in the context of output such as 
```c++
std::cout << "Hello world"
```
- does this shift the bits of hello world into the data stream of the output
