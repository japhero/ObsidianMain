In the United States Congress, the majority party exerts a substantial influence over lawmaking. However, even when one party has a numerical majority in each chamber of the United States Congress, there is no guarantee that legislation supported by that majority party will be passed by both chambers. Rules of each chamber independently influence the likelihood that legislation will pass in each chamber; legislation passed by one chamber is not always passed by the other.


## (A)
Describe **one advantage** that the majority party in the House and/or Senate has in lawmaking, **above and beyond the numerical advantage** that the majority party enjoys in floor voting.



The majority party gets to pick the Speaker of the house for example the current speaker of the house is Mike Johnson. The speaker of the house is the third most powerfull person in the country being the leader of the house of representatives 



## (B)
Describe **one difference between House and Senate rules** that may make it likely that legislation may pass in one chamber but not the other.


The filibuster is a tactic that can only be used in the senate making it more likely that legislation gets passed in the house before it gets passed in the senate.

## (C)
Explain how the difference identified in (b) can lead to the passage of a bill in one chamber but not the other.

House resolutions cannot be filibustered in the same mannar as senate bills therefore making it easier to collect a vote on a bill in the house as any bill proposed in the senate must pass several votes because of the filibuster and can be killed by the  filibuster.
