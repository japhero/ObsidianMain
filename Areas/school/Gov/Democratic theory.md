**Pluralist Theory:**

- “US Democracy = groups of people working in cooperation & compromise and solve problems.”
    

**Hyper pluralist Theory:**

- “US Democracy doesn’t work b/c strong groups in fierce competition use their voice to drown out opposition & the gov’t that is too weak and fragmented to do anything productive.”
    

**Elite Theory:**

- “US Democracy = an illusion! Regular people have no real say because elites use their money to control the government.”



- Government is a institution and the word represents the sytems taht create and organize a society.
- **Government functions**
	- Protect society (defence)
	- Provide for some needs of the public (social security)
	- Socialize the young
	- Raise money to pay for itself (tax things/people)
- Public policy are the tules and actions that a government makes to adress issues.
- **Who is responsible for making and setting public policy?**
	- Congress:
		- Laws
		- Budget
	- The president
		- Decisions/executive orders
		- Regulations
	- The courts 
		- Opinions and decisions they interpret the law
- **Linkage institutions:** linkage institutions connect people to policymakers and give people the influence to change laws
	- Parties
	- Elections
	- Media
	- intrest groups
		- NRA
		- Planned parenthood
		- NAACP
- **Political culture**
	- Why is the US fragmented?
		- I believe that the age of Social media is the cause for division as social media has made it possible to selectively transmit information whereas before most Americans trusted institutions for their information, these institutions usually follow a ethical journalistic approach and will mostly not spread openly false openly partisan talking points whereas nowadays it's extremely easy to become hyper partisan and only consume information that backs up your own bias. This compounded with hyper populism is a sort of perfect storm as the media's new nack for spreading false information or conflating a narrative makes it hard to combat openly false ideas such as the fact that the 2020 election was “stolen” as now 78% of republicans believe.
	- Generally policy making is easiest when the people are united.
