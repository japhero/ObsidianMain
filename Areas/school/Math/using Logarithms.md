# Canceling Logarithms  
To cancel a logarithm, raise both sides to the power of the base of the logarithm. For $\ln$ raise to the power of $e$.

> [!Example]- $\log_{3}(x^2+2) =0$
> Cube both sides because the left is $\log_{3}$ the 3 indicates the degree that the problem must be raised
> $\log_{3}(x^2+2)^3 =0^3$
> $x^2+2 = 0$
> Then solve for x by moving the 2 and $\sqrt {x^2}$
> $$x=\sqrt{ 2 }$$
