## Section 2.1

- A linear first order equation means that the

> Given $$y' +p(t)y=g(t) \text{ and } y(t_{0})=y_{0}$$
> If $p(t)$ and $g(t)$ are continuous on $(a,b)$ and $t_{0} \in (a,b)$,  there is a unique solution to the above initial value problem on $(a,b)$.

> As the theorem states intervals at which $t$ exists and there aren't discontinuities are intervals were we can find a unique solution. In this situation there are discontinuities on the intervals $-2,0$ and $5$. Since our $t$ value $3$ is in-between $0$ and $5$ the greatest interval is $0-5$



## Section 2.2 

- We solve these like we did in CALC 1 [[Differential equations]]



**Non homogenous equations**
- they arent separable 
- Being not homogenous means we have a $g(t)$ on the right side
- to solve we use something called the integrating factor
	- integrating factor is always $e^{\int p(t)\, dt}$
	- after finding the integrating factor multiply by it on both sides
