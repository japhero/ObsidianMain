**Nth order derivative**

$$
y^n=f(t,y,y',\dots,y^{(n-1)})
$$
 - General form of the first order general differential equation
 - the order of the differential equation correlates with the number of constants given eg second order equation will have at least 2 constants when solved.



## Section 1.3 Direction Fields

This is basically [[Slope Fields]]


**Isoclines**
- Are an optimization for finding the direction field for an ODE
- We find isoclines by sampling the derivative solving for the function and graphing it.

**Autonomous functions**

- Differential equations of the form below are called **Autonomous differential equations**  
$$
y'=f(y)
$$
- When the **autonomous function** takes the form $f(y)=0$ these solutions are called **equilibrium solutions** because the independent variable doesn't change.

## Questions
- What is the pourpace of isoclines if they aren't a function for the potential values like a slope field is
