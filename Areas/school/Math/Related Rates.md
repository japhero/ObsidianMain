# The general related rates pattern 

## Structure 
generally related rates problems follow a similar structure, you are given a [[Shapes Formulas|shape]] and values associated with the state or change of that shape. Notably, the shapes in regard to the question are only important because they represent a formula, as for example the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$ or a cylinder $\frac 4 3 \pi r^3$. The goal is usually to manipulate or solve these formulas for the values you don't know. This can mean getting the [[derivative]] or simply solving the standing formula($f(x)$). 


## Getting the equation 
Creating an equation out of the given information can be a complex system, but it usually develops down to using the fundamentals. The most significant thing to note is that combining formulas that you already know is typically the key. Some of these could be as easy as area of a rectangle,  $A = xy$  or area of a circle, $A=\pi r^2$. These principals are prevalent in formulas given, such as the $SA$ of a cylinder $\downarrow$

# DUMP
- make a formula solving for what you know
- take the derivative of that with respect to time $\frac{dx}{dt}$
- kind of similar to [[Implicit derivatives]] because we need to handle the relationships of different derivatives. It's like handling ][[Implicit derivatives]] but in the form of [[systems of equations]]
- Use $\tan(\theta)$ when a relationship between $\frac y x$ on a triangle because $\tan(\theta)$ is that relationship represented relative to $\theta$   
- [Conical tank](https://youtu.be/ps-r4nti5Go?t=3022) [[Shapes Formulas#Right Circular Cone|formula]]
	- use a ratio based on the original inputs when trying to formulate in terms of h 
	- example would be if the dimensions of the tank are $H =24, R =6, H=\frac {24} 6 r$ or $H = 4r$
	- 
- Read the problem several times lol
- Sometimes when using [[Pythagoreans Theorem]] to solve for triangles one must first solve for a side as a way to eliminate variables. Of course, remember to solve at the target position for example if it's asking to find some rate at $y=6$ make sure to only use the result of that calculation at $y = 6$ 
- make sure that you evenly distribute exponents  according to the [[Exponent Product rule]] for example $\left( \frac 1 3 x \right)^2$ distributed is $\frac 1 9 x^2$.
- [Shadow](https://youtu.be/ps-r4nti5Go?t=3532) 
	- Get similar triangles because $\tan = \tan$ so that ratio is the same.
	- Make sure when using similar triangles that the equation for each triangle is solving for the right variables usually the ones you have and the ones your looking for. Dont just solve for the values of the similar triangles manipulate them into the vars your looking for.
- [[Shapes Formulas#Spheres|Spheres]]  
	- Make sure to differentiate between $SA$ and $V$ . 
- derivative of a constant is 0 OMFG.
- normal rules such as [[Derivative Quotient rule| Quotient rule]] and [[Derivative Product rule|Product rule]] fully apply dont make dumb mistakes.
- Right Triangle
	- Think more about the exact value you want.
	- list out all the values you have and then think what you still need to get to plug in all your values 
- [[Shapes Formulas#Cylinders|Cylinders]] 
- [[Solving for theta]]
	- use the inverse of whatever trig function you are using.


## Problem mistakes

### HW 42
#hw
- didn't check the problem and inputted the wrong values for $x$ and $\frac{dx}{dt}$
