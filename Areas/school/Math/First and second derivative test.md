# The purpose of finding Concavity
Sometimes when given an equation one must ask why should i find concavity, whats the purpose of finding the second [[derivative]] when i can just use the first to graph the existing data. This leads me to the point that although we might have the direction of the graph when we take the first derivative we dont have the "shape", this works in a similar fashion to the difference between having $f(x)$ and $f'(x)=0$ we have the points but we dont know how or in what direction they shape.
