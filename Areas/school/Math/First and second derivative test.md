# The purpose of finding Concavity
Sometimes when given an equation one must ask why should i find concavity, what's the purpose of finding the second [[derivative]] when i can just use the first to graph the existing data. This leads me to the point that although we might have the direction of the graph when we take the first derivative we don't have the “shape”, this works in a similar fashion to the difference between having $f(x)$ and $f'(x)=0$ we have the points, but we don't know how or in what direction they shape.

# When do “spikes” exist 
Spikes in the context of the [[First and second derivative test]] are what are mathematically different and involve different have different “types”. Honestly, the word spikes simplifies many complicated mathematical concepts and should be described in unique scenarios.   

## Why don't spikes exists as a derivative
when looking at spikes and why the derivative doesn't exist we have to remember the basic definition of a [[derivative]] $L =\lim_{ h \to 0 } {\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}$ **it's a [[Limits|limit]]** therefore as it is a limit we have to remember that to be a valid [[Limits|limit]] the left hand and right hand have to evaluate to the same number. In basic terms, in all scenarios where the derivative doesn't exist while inside the domain and continuous it's because the limit doesn't evaluate as true. 

### Corners 
A function were at the point given the slope is infinite are not differentiable at that point. These places are called corners.

## Cusps
cusps are a another place were "spikes" exist and the again the concept of evaluating the limit again is applied. In the case of Cusps the lefthand and righthand limit evaluate to $\infty$ and $-\infty$.

- When putting negative exponents in the denominator remember it's not division its multiplying by the reciprocal
