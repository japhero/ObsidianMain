- differential questions arise when it's easier to express change than it is to express exact amounts
- **ordinary differential equations or ODE** are equations where the differential equation of set up with one input usually T
- **partial differential equations or PDE** or equations where multiple inputs are used
	-  represent a continuum of values changing over time
- $\dot{y} = y'$
- $\ddot{y} = y''$
-  the order of the equation is the amount of derivatives that you will find. For example, a second order equation will have at most two derivatives of one function.
- Any system of differential equations can be represented by a [[vector field]]
- more degrees of freedom rely on higher degrees of state, space, or in simpler terms the more degrees of freedom you add the more dimensions your equation will have.
-  in physics a [[Phase space]] it's a space in which the axes described are position and momentum
- I sometimes we can describe differential equations through spectrum of possible initial conditions
- you can analyze the similarities and structure in between equations by using [[Phase space|Phase spaces]]
-  we can approximate differential equations by instead of viewing derivatives as an infinitely small change relative to time we use a time step, and then calculate based on that time step changing add the time step as an interval in between "steps". 
	- this is called solving a differential equation numerically
