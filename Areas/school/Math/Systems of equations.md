## Non-Linear systems of equations


## Linear systems 

- A system of equation with infinitely many solutions means that the equations are the same

### Methods for Solving Linear systems  

#### Substitution 
- Substitution is when we express one of the variables in terms of another variable, substituite that variable and then solve for the singular variable.


> [!EXAMPLE]- $\text{Example 1:} \left(\begin{array}{r} 3x-y=23 \\4x+3y=48  \end{array}\right ) \text{using Substitution.}$
> 
> **1.** Make the first equation in terms of $y$ to prepare for substitution
> $$
> \begin{array}{r}
> 3x-y=23  \\  
> 3x=23+y \\
> y=3x-23 
> \end{array}
> $$
> **2.**  Now that we have $x$ in terms of $y$ we can substitute this back into the second equation and solve.
> $$
> \begin{array}{rr} 
> 4x+3(3x-23)=48  & \text{Substituted} \\
> 4x+9x-69=48   \\
> 13x=117 \\
> x=\frac{117}{13} \\
> x=9
> \end{array}
> $$
> **3.** Now that we have a value for $x$ we can substitute that value back into one of the original equations. This should then allow us to solve for $y$.
> $$
> \begin{array}{rr}
>  3(9)-y=23 \\
> 27-y=23 \\
> -y=23-27 \\
> y=4
> \end{array}
> $$
> **Solution** The solution to this system is $x=9,y=4$. This means that the two linear functions intersect at $(9,4).$
