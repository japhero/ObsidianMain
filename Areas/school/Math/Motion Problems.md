- First derivative is velocity 
- Second derivative is 
- If velocity positive moving to the right and if negative flip
- Deciding what derivative test to use based on what question is asked
	- Speed
	- Velocity
	- Direction?
- Physics problems LOL
- Displacement is the difference between the beginning and the END 
- Make sure that you decide when to integrate and when to derivative a

## Class Problems
> [!EXAMPLE]-  Part A: $s(t)=2t^3 -9t^2+12t-4$
> - Find all t for which the distance s is increasing 
> 	- This basically means use the first derivative test
> - Get $\frac {dy} {dx} S(t) = 6t^2-18t+12$ 
> - Then solve down to get the conflict points $t=2,t=1$
> - make the table:
> - and get an increasing interval of $a = (0,1),(2,\infty)$
> 

- Part B is just adding a derivative on the current problem and then doing it again
	- 
- Quadratics multiply to C and add to B : $ax^2+bx+c$
