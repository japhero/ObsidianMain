## Creating a slope field **KA**
- Its used to find out what a solution to [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] might look like.
- substitute in values for $x,y$ and then solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$
- why does a slope of zero have a flat line as its slope
	- Because we are visualizing the tangent line of a slope and when the slope is zero on any graph we have a flat line.
- SImilar to [[vector field]] almost exactly the same in the sense that they allows us to have an idea of how to solve [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] and in the case of slope fields the function given is a differential equation.
- Because slope fields are an expression of solutions of differential equations we can assume that
