- An antiderivative of a function f(x) isÂ **a function whose derivative is equal to f(x)**
- Is an antiderivative an integral.
- We have to add C to the end to represent all constants because when we have a derivative we always know that they could have constants that will never be represented.
- $\int$ is the symbol for integral
- Add one to the exponent and divide by that new exponent $$\frac{x^{a+1}}{a+1}$$
	- For example $x$ would have an antiderivative of $\frac 1 2 x^2$
	-  Or $x^2$ would have an antiderivative of $\frac {x^3} 3$
- To find $C$ we must have a value for $x$ then we find the anti derivative for the given value then set the equation = 0, substitute in our value and solve for $C$.
- Always remember to bring $C$ into the new equation when solving for c and having found 
- When we do several Antiderivatives  sequentially and we dont have a value for $C$ we must have several "C"s of those they cant be antiquated to be 1 value (unless you want to solve for the sum). This can be represented in $C +D$ or $C_1 + C_2$ some number representing that we are adding several constants.
- $S(t)= f(x)$
- $V(t) = f^\prime(x)$
- $A(t) = f^{\prime \prime}(x)$
- when solving for trig functions make sure to remember that the final goal is that 
- [[Trig derivatives]] can use for reference to solve but memorise for the quiz
