- An antiderivative of a function f(x) isÂ **a function whose derivative is equal to f(x)**
- Is an antiderivative an integral.
- We have to add C to the end to represent all constants because when we have a derivative we always know that they could have constants that will never be represented.
- $\int$ is the symbol for integral
- Add one to the exponent and divide by that new exponent $$\int x^a = \frac{x^{a+1}}{a+1}$$
	- For example $x$ would have an antiderivative of $\frac 1 2 x^2$
	-  Or $x^2$ would have an antiderivative of $\frac {x^3} 3$
- To find $C$ we must have a value for $x$ then we find the anti derivative for the given value then set the equation = 0, substitute in our value and solve for $C$.
- Always remember to bring $C$ into the new equation when solving for c and having found 
- When we do several Antiderivatives  sequentially and we dont have a value for $C$ we must have several "C"s of those they cant be antiquated to be 1 value (unless you want to solve for the sum). This can be represented in $C +D$ or $C_1 + C_2$ some number representing that we are adding several constants.
- $S(t)= f(x)$
- $V(t) = f^\prime(x)$
- $A(t) = f^{\prime \prime}(x)$
- when solving for trig functions make sure to remember that the final goal is that 
- [[Trig derivatives]] can use for reference to solve but memorize for the quiz  
- when we are solving for position and we get an input for $f(x)$ does the result of that input euqal the equation because when we solve for the constant we find whatever val will make that function equal to the result for example when  we have $f^\prime (x) = 2x^2$ and $f(1)= 0$ and its asking for the position given the data wont that position always be $0$ regardless of $f^\prime(x)$.
- when integrating infinite integrals such as $\int \frac{x^2-1} x$ we have to remove $x$ out of the denominator so $(x^2-1)x^{-1}$ then we can use the power rule

> [!example]- example: $\int \frac 7 {x+4}$
> we want to do is move the x out of the numerator. We can achieve this by getting the derivative with $\ln$ 
> First factor out 7:   $\frac 7 {x+4} = 7\frac1 {x+4}$ 
> then use $ln$ because $\frac d {dx} \ln(x) = \frac 1 x$ bc of the rule we know that the  : $7\ln(x+4)$ will be the antiderivative of the original function.
>  finally add c to represent constant:
> $$\int\frac 7 {x+4} =7\ln(x+4)+c$$
