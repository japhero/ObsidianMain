**Least squares theorem**

Let A be an $m \times n$ matrix and let b be in $\mathbb{R}^n$ then $Ax=b$ always has at least one least squares solution $\bar{x}$. Moreover:

a. $\bar{x}$ is a least squares solution of $Ax=b$ if and only if $\bar{x}$ is a solution of the normal equations $A^TA \bar{x}=A^Tb$.

b. $A$ has linearly independent columns if and only if $A^TA$ is invertible. In this case, the least squares solution of $Ax=b$ is unique and is given by 
$$
\bar{x}=(A^TA)^{-1} A^Tb
$$
