#### Gaussian elimination 
- Write the augmented matrix 
- Use elementary row operations to reduce the augmented matrix to row echelon form
- Using back substitution solve the equivalent system 




#### Rank theorem 
let A be the coefficient matrix of a system of linear equations with $n$ variables. If the system is consistent, then 
$$
\text{number of free variables}=n- \text{rank}(A)
$$
**RANK IS THE AMOUNT OF USEFULL EQUATIONS**
