## Class 
$$\text{average value }= \frac{1}{b-a}\int^b_{a}f(x) \, dx$$
- total amount divided by the difference
- if your function is continues on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval (no spikes) then it contains a place where the derivative is the same as the average slope of the interval.
$$
\text{Mean Value Theorem }f'(c)=\frac{{f(b)-f(a)}}{b-a}
$$
- Remember its not aplicable if the interval is neither differentiable nor continuous
