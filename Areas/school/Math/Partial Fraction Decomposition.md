## Expansion
- Write the fraction as a expression as the sum of 2 rational expressions with a lower degree in the denominator.
- Again we want a higher degree in the original denominator
- factor the denominator of the original rational expression 
- Expand it for each factor?
- after expanding for each factor we want to multiply the numerator by the common denominator 
- can distribute the coefficients of the several rational expressions and then solve for a system of equations.

- First expand by each factor 
- Then multiply by the denominator of the original function which should be the common denominator.

**Integration**
- Just do normal decomposition and then take the integral of the seperated rational expressions
- $\int \frac{a}{x}+\frac{b}{x+2} \, dx =\int \frac{a}{x} \, dx +\int \frac{b}{x+2} \, dx$
