- Integrals $\int  \, dx$ are really sums $\sum$
- No need for $C$ because the limits of the integral assure its not needed because the result is finite.
- are integrals just the sum of values at infinitely close spaces or $dx$.
- To solve for the definite integral substitute your values given and then subtract.
