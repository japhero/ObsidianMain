list of all mistakes made in a certain homework to allow me to evaluate what i need to work on.



# Exam Review 2 
- when removing negative exponent forgot to transfer the coefficient into a fraction.
- Wrote down the problem with the wrong exponent
- forgot to negate from a negative exponent when taking derivative treated it as a positive. example $x^{-1/4}$  turned into $x^{-3/4}$ instead of $x^{-5/4}$.
- forgot to carry the factored value into the next equation

## HW 51
- what happens to $du$ during the power rule 
- how do i solve for $du$ 
- Forgot twice to carry the negative over when taking the derivative of u



# Hw 52
- need to learn [[Factoring polynomials#Factor by grouping]] 
- factored the polynomial wrong
-
