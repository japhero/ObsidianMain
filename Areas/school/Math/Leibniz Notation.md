In calculus, Leibniz's notation, named in honor of the 17th-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, uses the symbols dx and dy to represent infinitely small (or infinitesimal) increments of x and y, respectively, just as Δx and Δy represent finite increments of x and y, respectively.[(-wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%27s_notation#:~:text=In%20calculus%2C%20Leibniz's%20notation%2C%20named,of%20x%20and%20y%2C%20respectively.)

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du} \times \frac{du}{dx}
$$
$$
\lim_{ \Delta x \to 0 } =\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}
= \lim_{ \Delta x \to  0 } \frac{{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}}{\Delta x}
$$
