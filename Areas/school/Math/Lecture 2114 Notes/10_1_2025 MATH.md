- The dimension of a space is the number of vectors in any basis for that space 
$$
\text{dim}(\mathbb{R}^n)=n
$$
- bc every basis has $n$ vectors 


**subspace**
- a set of vectors $S$, is a subspace if 
	- $\vec{0}\in S$
	- $\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in S$ for all $\vec{u}, \vec{v} \in S$
	- $C \vec{v}\in S$


trivial subspace is the subspace with only the zero vector $(\vec{0})$ 
- an example of a subspace would be $\text{span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\1 \\1 \end{bmatrix}\right)$

-  A span will always be a subspace



- let $A-m \times n$ matrix and consider $A \vec{x}= \vec{0}$ define the null space of A as 
$$\Large \text{Null} (A) =\vec{x} \in\mathbb{R}^n|A \vec{x}= \vec{0}$$
ie the solutions to the homogenous system.
- to find $\text{Null}(A)$ we solve the system using $\vec{0}$ as our constants $\vec{b}$ giving the homogenous system.
- Note that the Null space is a set of vectors as it is the set of all solutions to the homogenous system which will always at least have the zero vector $\vec{0}$ as a solution
- The null space is always a subspace

## Definitions
- let $A-m \times n$ matrix and consider $A \vec{x}= \vec{0}$ define the null space of A as 
$$\Large \text{Null} (A) =\vec{x} \in\mathbb{R}^n|A \vec{x}= \vec{0}$$
ie the solutions to the homogenous system.


- Given $A- m \times n$ then $\text{Null}(A)  \subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\text{dim}(\text{Null(A)})= \text{number of free variables}$ also called the nullity

## Questions
- For a given set of vectors are the basis vectors the smallest set of vectors possible that have a span of all of our original set.
