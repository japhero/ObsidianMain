# Lecture Notes
- when solving linear systems we can look at the problems geometrically meaning both equations are a line and the point that intersects that line is the solution. 
	- This is why when given the same equation with a different multiplier we know that the solution is $\infty$ because the lines are the same. 
- When given a equation where the slope is the same but the y-intercept is different we know that this linear system has no solutions because the lines are parallel and never intersect --> [[Math notes]]
- In this class Scalars will almost always be Real numbers $(\mathbb R)$

### Vectors
- Vectors are mathematically represented regardless of their relative location. This means that 2 vectors in different "places" with the same displacement are the same vector. EG:
$$
[](3,3,),(8,6)] = [(0,0),(5,3)]
$$
- The zero vector can have $n$ components 
- We never multiply vectors 



#### Vector Notation
$$\vec{AB}$$
> Where $A$ is the initial point and $B$ is the terminal point

**Colum Vectors**
$$
\vec{x}=[x_{1},x_{2}] =\left[\begin{matrix}
x_{1} \\
x_{2}
\end{matrix} \right]
$$

#### Vector Operations
$$
\vec{X}+\vec{V}=(x_{1}+v_{1},x_{2}+v_{2})
$$
- We just add the components 
- Vectors are commutative 
$$
c\vec{x} = [cx_{1},cx_{2},cx_{3}\dots cx_{n}]
$$
- Multiplying by scalars simply multiplies the components and in effect changes its magnitude. This can change the direction of the vector if we use a negative number to manipulate the vector.

#### Vector properties
The following are always true
$$
\begin{array}
\vec{x}+\vec{v}=\vec{v}+\vec{x} \\
\vec{x}+\vec{0}=\vec{x} \\
0\vec{x}=\vec{0} \\

\end{array}
$$

#### Linear Combinations
let $\vec{V} \in \mathbb R^n$ and also let $\vec{x_{1}}, \vec{x_{2}},\vec{x_{3}} \dots ,\vec{x_{k}}\in \mathbb R^n$
we say that $\vec{v}$ is a linear combination of $\vec{x},\vec{x_{2}}\dots \vec{x_{k}}$ if there exist scalers $c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\dots c_{k} \in \mathbb R^n$

## Questions
- what is commutative 
	- I think $x_{1}+x_{2}=x_{2}+x_{1}$. meaning that the order of addition doesn't matter to the result. o

&emsp;
## Definitions 
- **A vector** is a directed line segment 
- The vector with its head and tail at $(0,0,0,\dots 0)$ is called the **Zero Vector**
