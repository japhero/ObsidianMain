- The non-pivot columns of a matrix correspond to the free variables 
	- ONLY IN REF

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc|c}
1 & 4 & 2 & 6  & 4\\
0 & 1 & 3 & 8 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 6
\end{array}
\right]
$$
> column 3 would be the free variable column and columns $1,2$ and $4$ would be the pivot columns. 

- Homogenous system is any linear system where the constant side has all zeros to it.
$$\left[
\begin{array}{cccc|c}
1 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 0 \\
5 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 0 \\
6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 0 \\
100 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
$$
- usually we separate away the solutions and just take the main part calling it the coefficient matrix $[A|\space \not b]$ 
## Definitions
- The first non zero entry in a row of a matrix is called a **leading entry** 
- We say that a matrix is in row echelon form if 
	- Any row of zeros is at the bottom 
	- Any leading entry is in a column with no leading entries below it 
	- EG:
$$ [A|b]=
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 5 & 3 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & 4  & 3\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 5 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$
- A useful equations is a equation that represents a unique relationship between variables  
- The **rank** of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows when in REF
	- This definition replaces useful equations. 
- a pivot Column is the column in which our leading entry is in REF. So for the equation above all 3 are pivot columns
