**Def**
A Non-zero vector $\vec{x}$ is an eigenvector of $A$, if there exists scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ when, $A \vec{x}=\lambda\vec{x}$ considering $\lambda$ the eigenvalue of $A$ associated with $\vec{x}$

- zero vector is not an eigenvector
- is a constant which does the same thing as a linear transformation to a given vector (the eigenvector)
- A can only be square for eigenvalues/vectors to exist.

$$
(A- \lambda I_{n})  \vec{x}= \vec{0}
$$
> compute the homogenous system for a given eigenvalue to find the set of eigenvectors for that value

## questions

- Considering there could be many different eigenvectors and eigenvalues for a given matrix are eigenvectors and eigenvalues a subspace of the standard matrix of the given linear transformation?
