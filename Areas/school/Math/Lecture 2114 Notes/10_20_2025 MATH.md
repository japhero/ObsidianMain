**Def**
A Non-zero vector $\vec{x}$ is an eigenvector of $A$, if there exists scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ when, $A \vec{x}=\lambda\vec{x}$ considering $\lambda$ the eigenvalue of $A$ associated with $\vec{x}$

- zero vector is not an eigenvector
- is a constant which does the same thing as a linear transformation to a given vector (the eigenvector)x
- A can only be square for eigenvalues/vectors to exist.

$$
(A- \lambda I_{n})  \vec{x}= \vec{0}
$$
> compute the homogenous system for a given eigenvalue to find the set of eigenvectors for that value

**Def** Determinants 

$$
A =

\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$Det(A)=ad-bc$


Notation given A $n\times n$. Let $A_{ij}$ be the matrix where we eliminate row $i$ and column $j$
$$
A= \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}, \,
B_{\text{reduced}} =\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- This is where we reduced A by removing column 1 and row 1 



**Calculating the Determinant**

To calculate $Det(A)$ you can "expand" upon row $i$ 
$$
Det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}(-1)^{i+j} \cdot \det(A_{ij})
$$


- We can only do the determinant on square matrices 
- When given a matrix larger than $3\times 3$ one must reduce each "internal" determinant recursively untill given a $2 \times 2$ matrix where the formula $\det (A_{2 \times 2})=ad-bc$ 


- The determinant of an trianglular matrix is just the product of the diagonals 

## questions

- Considering there could be many different eigenvectors and eigenvalues for a given matrix are eigenvectors and eigenvalues a subspace of the standard matrix of the given linear transformation?
