- The pivot columns correspond to the the generators of the span
- The amount of pivot columns in the resulting matrix give us the shape of the solution set
	- EG if we are in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and i have 2 pivot columns then i know that $span(A)$ is going to be a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$
	- To determine the proper generators of $span( \vec{v_{1}}\dots  \vec{v_{k}})$ determine the pivot columns of $A=( \vec{v}_{1}\dots   \vec{v}_{k})$ they correspond to the generators
	- If you have a leading entry/pviot colum for every row in the augmented matrix than the set of vectors will span $\mathbb{R}^n$ 


- Vectors that are linearly independent will have a span of $\mathbb{R}^n$ where $n$ is the number of linearly independent vectors with $n$ rows 


- Let $\vec{v_{1}} \dots \vec{v_{k}} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. We say $(\vec{v_{1}}\dots  \vec{v_{k}})$ is a linearly independent set if the equation $c_{1}\vec{v_{1}} +c_{2}\vec{v_{2}}=\vec{0}$ is only solvable if $c_{1}=c_{2}=c_{i}=0$ 

- To determine if a set of vectors is linearly independent we need to find the solution set for those vectors in a homogenous system.
