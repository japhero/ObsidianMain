# Lecture Notes
- A $m \times n$ matrix is an array of numbers. With $m$ number of rows and $n$ number of columns.  
- There are $m*n$ entries in a $m \times n$ matrix. 
- Two matrices are the same when every entry in the either matrix is the same. 
- Capital letter denotes the matrix eg $A$ 
- Lowercase letter with subscript denotes the index of the entry eg $a_{11}$
- An entry of matrix $A$ is represented by $a_{ij}$
- We can write a generic matrix $A-(m \times n)$ as 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \dots  & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}  \dots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots \\
a_{m_{2}} & a_{m2} \dots  & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Matrix Operations
- Matrix addition is just adding each individual component to its respective partner in the other matrix
- The letter O represents the 0 matrix

### Matrix powers
- we can only take powers of square matrices 



## Solving linear systems with matrices
- We can think of a vector as a $n\times 1$ vector
- 


## Definitions
- Let $I_{n}$ be the $n\times n$ matrix with 1 on the "main diagonal" and 0s everywhere else $I_{n}$ is the "identity matrix"
$$
I_{3}=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- The identity matrix multiplied by another equally sized matrix will give that other matrix back $I_{nn}A_{nn}=A_{nn}$
