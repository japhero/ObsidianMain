## Intro into material 

- For solving linear systems we have several "former" methods
	- Elimination 
		- Summate the variables 
	- Substitution


### Definitions

- **Functions are a relationship where each input has exactly one output.**

### Sets
- A sets, is any collection of elements 
	- {} denote that everything internal to the brackets are items in the set 
		- {1,2,3}
-  $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers
  - $\mathbb{z}$ is the set of all integers
	  - Because $\mathbb{R}$ contains all integers $\mathbb{R} > \mathbb{Z}$
- subset symbol equal $\subseteq$; this tells me that all of one set is contained in the other set
- The $\in$ symbol tells me if an element is in a set. 
	- Ex: $2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ or 2 is inside of integers
- The $\notin$ symbol simply means that the item is not in the set.


#### Special sets 
- $\mathbb{R}^2-(x,y)$ , where $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $y \in \mathbb{R}$
- $\mathbb{R^n}$ is the set in which there is $n$ number of points
