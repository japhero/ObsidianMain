- We have no solutions when we get inconsistent answers $1 \ne 3$
- We have infinitely many solutions when we have more variables than useful equations 
- We have a unique solution when we have the same amount of variables as we do useful equations. 
- To get the amount of free variables subtract the amount of variables from the number of equations. 
	- $3 \text{ variables} -2 \text{ equations }= 2\text{ free variables}$
- Always solve for the "dependent" variables in terms of the independent variables. 




- Within an augmented matrix $\vec{b}$ is the constant side 

- Row operations
	- Adding a multiple of a one row to another row
	- Exchanging rows 
	- Multiplying by a scalar constant. 


## Definitions
$$
\text{proj}_{\vec{u}}(\vec{v})= \left( \frac{\vec{u}\cdot \vec v}{\vec{u} \cdot \vec u} \right) \vec{u}
$$



- In a linear system an independent variable is called a free variable 



## Questions
1. Isnt this the case where we have more variables than useful equations?
2. What is the exact parametric form for a solve linear system?
