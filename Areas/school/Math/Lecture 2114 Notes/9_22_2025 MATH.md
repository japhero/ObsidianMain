$$
A^{-1}=\frac{1}{ad-bc}

> Note that if $ad-bc=0$  $A$ is not invertible  


- Multiplying a matrix by its inverse gives us the square identity for that size matrix
- **Theorem:** If $A$ is invertible the system $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has a unique solution this being $\vec{x}= A^{-1} \space \vec{b}$
- **Theorem:** Supposed $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix then $A$ is invertible if and only if A is row equivalent to $I_{n}$ I.e. $A$ is in RREF is $I_{n}$. 
	- $I_{n}$ is the identity matrix for size $n$
 
- To get the inverse of a matrix take a matrix of size $n \times n$ and bring it to RREF but do any operation done on $A$ and do it to the $I_{n}$ of $A's$ respective size

$$
A=\left[
\begin{array}{ccc | ccc}
1 & 2 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 4 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
5 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$
> now do both row operations on both sides


#### **Fundamental Theorem of invertible matrices**
T.F.E.A (The following are equivalent)
let $A$ be a $n\times n$ square matrix
- $A$ is invertible 
- $A$ is row equivalent to $I_{n}$.
- The rank of $A$ is equal to $n$.
- The system $A \vec{x}= \vec{b}$ is consistent for any $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ 
- The system $A \vec{x}= \vec{b}$ only has a unique solution $\vec{x}=A^{-1}  \space\vec{b}$
- The system $A \vec{x}= \vec{0}$ only has the trivial solution $\vec{x}= \vec{0}$



#### 2.3
- Span and linear independence
- let $\vec{v_{2}},\vec{v_{2}},\dots  \vec{v_{k}}$ be a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The span of these vectors, denoted by $\text{span}(\vec{v_{1}}\dots  \vec{v_{k}})$, is the set of all linear combinations of these vectors.
