- All this is saying is that if the set contains one pair of vectors that isn't orthogonal to each other then the entire set isn't orthogonal 
- Note if $S$ is an orthogonal set it must be Linearly independent

> A basis, that is also an orthogonal set is an **orthogonal basis**.

- The orthogonal complement is a subspace such that every vector within $W$ is orthogonal to $\vec{x}$
