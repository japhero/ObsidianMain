Column space of $A$ or $\text{col}(A)$ where $A=(\vec{v_{1}},\dots  \vec{v_{n}})$ where $\vec{v_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^n}$ the column space of $A$ or $\text{col(A)} = \text{span}( \vec{v_{1}},\dots  \vec{v_{n}} )$. 

- To find a basis for $\text{col(A)}$ put $A$ in REF, the pivot columns correspond to the basis vectors Furthermore the dimension of $\text{Col}(A)$ is always the $\text{rank}(A)$ 
- When we have an invertible matrix the column space will be all of $\mathbb{R}^n$ because every column will be a pivot column and therefore be 


- We can relate the rank theorem to nullity 
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{Nullity}(A) + \text{Rank}(A)=n \\
\text{\# of free var} +\text{non-zero equations = \# of variables}
\end{array}
$$



- **Row space**
 Let $A- m \times n$. 
Suppose 
$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{v_{1}} \\
\vdots \\
\vec{v_{m}}
\end{bmatrix}
, \vec{v_{v}} \in\mathbb{R}^n,$$
- Each $\vec{v_{1}}$ is a row vector. Then the row space of $A$ is $\text{Row(A)}= \text{span}(v_{1},\dots v_{m}) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ 
- This is always a subspace
- To find a basis for $\text{Row}(A)$ turn $A$ into REF. The non-zero rows are the basis vectors 
- Rank tells me the dimension of the row space and the column space 


- Note $\text{dim}(Row(A))=\text{dim}(Col(A))=\text{Rank}(A)$
- In general, the max rank of an $m\times n$ is $\text{min}(m,n)$





#### Function Notation

- **DEF**: A function is any relation where every input has exactly one output. 

- **Domain**
- **DEF:** For any function, define the domain to be the set of inputs and the target space where, the set where the outputs go. 

$$
F:D \to A
$$
For a basic function that spans all of the x-axis like $f(x)=x^2$
$$
F:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}
$$



- The range unlike the targets are a set of the realized values of a certain function 
- Example $f(x)=x^2$
- $\text{Range}(f)=[0,\infty]$
- $g;\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$

- The domain and the range correspond to the number of columns and the number rows
$$
A:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m
$$
> where $n$ and $m$ are the number of rows and columns of the matrix respectively




**Def** 
A function $T$, where $T:\mathbb{R}^n \to  R^m$ is a linear transformation if 
1. $T(\vec{x}+  \vec{y}) =T(\vec{x})+T(\vec{y}))$, for all $\vec{x}, \vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
2. $T(c \vec{x})= cT(\vec{x})$, for all of $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n, space c \in \mathbb{R}$

- All matrices are linear transformations 
- $\vec{b} \in \text{Range(A)} \leftrightarrow A \vec{x}=\vec{b} \text{ is consistent}$

- In general for any $m \times n$ matrix $A$, the range of $A$ is the column space. 














$A( \vec{x})= \vec{b}$
-  where target = $\vec{b}$ 


If $A-m\times n$ 
- Then we know that $A:\mathbb{R}^n \to R^m$
- To figure out if $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, is in the range of A, we need to find $\vec{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ where $A \vec{x}=\vec{b} \leftrightarrow (A|B)$ is consistent

## Questions
- What does it mean to be a subspace of something not in the sense of what is a subspace but what does it mean to be a <u>subspace of something else</u> 
	- Being a subspace of something means that the "parent" space contains all of the items of the "child space"
$$
\text{"child" space} \subseteq \text{"Parent" Space}  
$$
- What is the difference between a Range and a target space



Written Assignment  6: Problem 2 
-  **False**
- Within this problem the $k$ subspace is a subspace that is one degree smaller than the parent space. For example a line within a 2d plane the line has one dimension the whole plane has dimension 2. Therefore it is not true that any set of vectors within the plane will form a basis for the line because to be a basis these vectors must be on the line and this is not a given.



- **Problem 4a in Written assignment 5**

$$
\vec{x} \in \text{Null}(AB) \leftrightarrow AB \vec{x}= \vec{0}
$$
- Because within matrix multiplication the order doesn't matter the null space of $AB$ will be anything that makes either $A$ or $B$ zero because after $A$ or $B$ is the zero vector the entire equation will become the zero vector soo
$$
\text{Nullspace(AB)} = \text{Nullspace}(A) + \text{Nullspace}(B) 
$$


$\text{Nullity}(A)$  is the dimension of the null space.
