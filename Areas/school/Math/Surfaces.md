**Ellipses**
- Coefficients make inversely effect the length of their axis. This means if i have $5x^2+y^2=z$  the intersections with the $x$ axis are going to be smaller eg

**Circles formula with negative Coefficients**
- If we have the circle formula $x^2+y^2=r^2$ but $x$ or $y$ has a negative coefficient lets say $-x^2+y^2=r^2$ this formula now inverts giving 2 parabola like shapes eg.
