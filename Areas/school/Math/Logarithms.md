# Canceling Logarithms  
To rid an equation of logarithms, raise both sides to the same exponent as the base of the logarithms.
$$\log_{a}(a^x)=x$$
remember that when doing this to $\ln$ we use the base of $e$.


# Finding $e^C$ when solving for integrals .
Sometimes when try to cancel logarithms we end up with a sinario where we to remove $\ln$ we raised $e$ to the power of $C$. Because this makes it incredibly hard to solve for $C$ we can replace $C$ with $K$ and just realize that we are still representing a constant therefore its. But note when pluging it in we still have to treat it as what it is an exponent of $e$.

## Derivative of log
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\log_{a} x) = \frac{1}{x'\ln a}$$

## Derivative of $\ln$
$$\frac{d}{dx}\ln \left[ f(x) \right] =\frac{1}{f(x)} f'(x)$$
## $Ln$ of 1
$$\ln(1)=0$$

# logarithm question (intuition)
The log question is the idea of representing log as a logical expression or a method of thinking through the operation of log. We can see this thought process when we think through division, as how many groups of one number do i have. For logarithms this question is ==**what exponent will make my base equal to my argument**==. We can also see this in the formula.
