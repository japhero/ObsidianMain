# Canceling Logarithms  
To cancel a logarithm, raise both sides to the power of the base of the logarithm. For $\ln$ raise to the power of $e$.

> [!Example]- $\log_{3}(x^2+2) =0$
> Cube both sides because the left is $\log_{3}$ the 3 indicates the degree that the problem must be raised
> $\log_{3}(x^2+2)^3 =0^3$
> $x^2+2 = 0$
> Then solve for x by moving the 2 and $\sqrt {x^2}$
> $$x=\sqrt{ 2 }$$

# Derivative of log
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\log_{a} x) = \frac{1}{x\ln a}$$

# logarithm question
The log question is the idea of representing log as a logical expression or a method of thinking through the operation of log. We can see this thought process when we think through division, as how many groups of one number do i have. For logarithms this question is ==**what exponent will make my base equal to my argument**==. We can also see this in the formula.
