# Canceling Logarithms  
To rid an equation of logarithms, raise both sides to the same exponent as the base of the logarithms.
$$\log_{a}(a^x)=x$$

> [!EXAMPLE]- $\ln(3x^2-2)=0$
> 
> **Step 1**
> First raise both sides to the quantity inside of the natural log.
> $\ln(3x^2-2)^{(3x^2-2)}=0^{(3x^2-2)} \to 3x^2-2=0^{(3x^2-2)}$
> 
> **Step 2**

## Derivative of log
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\log_{a} x) = \frac{1}{x'\ln a}$$

## Derivative of $\ln$
$$\frac{d}{dx}\ln \left[ f(x) \right] =\frac{1}{f(x)} f'(x)$$
## $Ln$ of 1
$$\ln(1)=0$$

# logarithm question
The log question is the idea of representing log as a logical expression or a method of thinking through the operation of log. We can see this thought process when we think through division, as how many groups of one number do i have. For logarithms this question is ==**what exponent will make my base equal to my argument**==. We can also see this in the formula.
