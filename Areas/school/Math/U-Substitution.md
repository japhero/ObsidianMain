## Class Notes
$$\int  \, u^ndu= \frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1}+C $$

- [[Antiderivatives-integrals]] is a type of [[U-Substitution]]?
- [[U-Substitution]] is literaly substituiting the value $u$ instead of a variable.
- isnt it just operating as a kind of [[chain rule]]
- Â **$u$-substitution**, which basically reverses the chain rule.
- $u$ is the internal part of the [[chain rule]]
- $u$ is an implicit function of the main function of $f(x)$
- the reason that we have to manipulate $du$ by multiplying or dividing the whole equation is because we want $du$ to be the derivative of $u$ and in a normal chain rule this would be what we are multiplying by. 
	- simply we want $du$ to be the $g'$ in $f'\left(g(x) \right)g'(x)$ of the [[chain rule#Formula|chain rule formula]].
- $du$ goes away when i take the integral its kindov symbolic and just goes away.
- $du$ is kindov used as a vessle for geting rid of "products" of taking the derivative
- $$\int [f(x)+g(x)] \, dx  = \int f(x) \, dx + \int g(x) \, dx  $$
- The goal with $u$ should allways be to remove x from the equation
- can use trig definitions to change into a form that we can solve.
- $\frac{dy}{dx}=2e^{x-y} \to \frac{dy}{dx} =\frac{2e^x}{e^y}$
	- Just a neet usage of [[exponent rules]] 
- chosing what value you use for u is very important maby when compressing use as example $$\int \frac{\cos\left( (1-3x)^{\frac 1 3} \right)}{(1-3x)^ {\frac{2}{3}}} \, dx$$


## Vid1 notes
- What we need to do
	-  find $u$
	- find $du$
- $du$ is the derivative of $u$, $du=u'$
- we want all x variables to in the form of $u$

## Finding U notes
- finding u is really 
- Do we just put everything thats not U as in the function solving fro $du$
