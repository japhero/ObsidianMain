- Used to transfer from time domain to the s domain
- notation $\mathscr{L}(f(t)) \to F(S)$
- transform takes you from one set of functions to another set of functions.
- $$\mathscr L(f(t)) =\int_{0}^{∞} e^{-st}f(t) \, dt$$
	- is an Improper integral.
- The notation of the integral can also be written as a limit
	- $\displaystyle \mathscr L (f(t))=\lim_{ a \to \infty } \int_{0}^a e^{-st} \, dt$
	- we do this because we cant actually evaluate ∞ we have to take the $\lim_{ a \to \infty }$


## What does the Laplace transform really tell us.
- Laplaces tells us what freuqencys and what exponential decay is in a function.
- Y intercept of forier transform is the area of a curve or the $\int$ of the function.
- we need 2 dimensions to represent the imaginary and real axis of the function.
