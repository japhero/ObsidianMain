list of all mistakes made in a certain homework to allow me to evaluate what i need to work on.



# Exam Review 2 
- when removing negative exponent forgot to transfer the coefficient into a fraction.
- Wrote down the problem with the wrong exponent
- forgot to negate from a negative exponent when taking derivative treated it as a positive. example $x^{-1/4}$  turned into $x^{-3/4}$ instead of $x^{-5/4}$.
- forgot to carry the factored value into the next equation

## HW 51
- what happens to $du$ during the power rule 
- how do i solve for $du$ 
- Forgot twice to carry the negative over when taking the derivative of u



# Hw 52
- need to learn [[Factoring polynomials#Factor by grouping]] 
- factored the polynomial wrong


# HW 87
to aproximate a slope between 2 points its $\frac{{y_{2}-y_{1}}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}$.



# AP 2015 MCQ 
**question 4 d**
- $y= mx+b$
- $\frac{dy}{dx}= m$
	- Is an identity when just taking the first normal derivative with normal rules following [[Implicit derivatives]] principals
- using the identity of the second derivative $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=2-\frac{dy}{dx}$ we can just plug in our identities found to get $0=2-m$  because $\frac{dy}{dx}=m$ and $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} =0$. so that means that $m$ is 2. 
- Then we can plug in the identity of m for $\frac{dy}{dx}$and plug it in as 2 meaning we get $2-2x+y$ then solve for y and get $y=2x-2$ giving us b because $y=mx +b$.
- One solving trick for difficult equations is to write down everything we know and then look for answers.

If the tangent line is always greater than the function of $f$ it means that $f$ must be concave down because if the line was concave up then the function would be above the tangent line.

# HW 90
- asymptotes
$\frac{x^n}{x^m}$
1. If n < m, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0.
2. If n = m, the horizontal asymptote is y = a/b.
3. If n > m, there is no horizontal asymptote.
