## Class 
$$\text{average value }= \frac{1}{b-a}\int^b_{a}f(x) \, dx$$
- total amount divided by the difference
- We use the integral becasue it represents all the values of the function added up together or the area
- if your function is continues on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval (no spikes) then it contains a place where the derivative is the same as the average slope of the interval.
$$
\text{Mean Value Theorem }f'(c)=\frac{{f(b)-f(a)}}{b-a}= \Delta
$$
- Remember its not aplicable if the interval is neither differentiable nor continuous  

## Application
- how do you find the point C?
- Its hard to remember to do the devison after taking the integral becasue u dont touch it untill the end so write it as a combined with the orrigonal integral to act as a reminder.
## Trick 
if you have the find the average rate of change of a graph you can draw a line in between the 2 endpoints and the slope of that line will be the slope of the average rate of change.
