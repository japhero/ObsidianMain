- FTC = fundamental theorem of calc
- $$fig_{1} =\int_{a}^b f(x)  \, dx =F(b)-F(a)$$
	- **Newtonâ€“Leibniz theorem**
	- Second fundamental Theorem of calculus 
	- $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$^[]
- $$First \space FDC= \frac{d}{dx}\int_{a}^x f(t) \, dt=f(x)dx$$
	- In the definiton it states that $F'(x)$ has to equal $f(x)$ this means conventionally that we can just take the function $f(x)$ but we run into problems when $x$ in $\int^x_{0}$  isnt just x. The reason it works in the first case and for the definition is because the derivative of x is 1 but for cases where x is not just x take the derivative thats why $F'(x)=f(x)dx$ as a general rule.
- rather than taking the full integral by substituting and then taking the derivative simply substitue in the function into $f(x)$ and then multiply by the derivative of $f(x)$ 
	- Thats what $fig_{2}$ represents 
- You can flip the limits of integration but you then have to flip the sign.
- becasue we need a constant as a if we are given an integral with 2 variables we can split them into 2 different integrals.  $$\int^{x^2}_{x} f(x) \, dx. = -\int_{0}^x f(x)  \, dx +\int^{x^2}_{0} f(x)   \, dx$$
