### Alternating Series test
If we have a Series in the form $\sum a_{n}$ and either $a_{n}=(-1)^n b_{n}$ or $a_{n}=(-1)^{n+1}b_{n}$ where $b_{n}>0$. Then if 


$$
\begin{array}{\l}
1. \displaystyle \lim_{ n \to \infty } b_{n}=0 \text{ and,}  \\ \\

2. \{b_{n}\}  \text{ is a decreasing sequence}
\end{array}


$$
the series $\sum a_{n}$ is convergent

# DUMP
- An alternating series is any series that is in the form $\sum a_{n}$ for which the terms can be written as 
	1.  $a_{n}=(-1)^nb_{n}$  where $b_{n}\geq 0$
	2. $a_{n}=(-1)^{n+1}b_{n}$ where $b_{n}\geq 0$
- [[Series#Alternating Series test|Alternating Series Test]] is what we can use to determine if the series is divergent.
	- Note this test  only tells us if the series is convergent 
- For a alternating series to  be convergent it doesnt have to be decreasing for all of $n$ only for enough of it to make the series converge.
