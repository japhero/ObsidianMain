The [[Quadratic Formula]] is a formula used to [[Factoring polynomials|factor polynomials]] it is useful when other methods like [[Factoring polynomials#Factor by grouping|factoring through grouping]] or [[Factoring polynomials#Factor when $a=1$|box method]] don't work. The variables in the formula are taken from the quadratic equation $(ax^2+bx+c)$ and to apply the Quadratic Formula you simply plug in the comparable variables.
$$
\large{x=\frac{{b \pm \sqrt{ b^2-4ac }}}{2a}}

## The Discriminant 
The Discriminant is a term used to describe part of the [[Quadratic Formula]], specifically $\sqrt{ b^2 -4ac}$ this equation is useful to determine how many solutions a certain quadratic equation has.

| Discriminant                       | `#` of solutions  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Real Number          $x \neq 0$    | Two solutions     |
| Zero                         $x=0$ | One real solution |
| Imaginary number $x = i$           | No solutions      |
