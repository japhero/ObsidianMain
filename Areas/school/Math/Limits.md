- [[L'H么pital's rule]]
- You can use trig definitions to apply [[L'H么pital's rule]]

> [!EXAMPLE]- $\displaystyle \lim_{ x \to 0 } = x\csc(x)$ (question 6 on HW 50)
> **Step1** 
> Because we know that another defintion for $\csc(x)$ is $\frac{1}{\sin(x)}$ we can apply that defintion to make [[L'H么pital's rule]] applicable. Then carry the x up to get $\frac{x}{\sin (x)}$ this still will give $\frac{0}{0}$ when substituting 0 in for x.
> 
> **Step2** 
> Apply [[L'H么pital's rule]] by taking the derivative of the numorator: $1$ and the denominator $\cos(x)$. Giving the equation $\frac{1}{\cos(x)}$. This is now more friendly to substitution and when done it gives $\frac{1}{1}$ $$\frac{1}{\cos(x)}=1$$ 

- Take the coefficient of the number with the greatest exponent, for example $\frac{{x^2+2x+5}}{4x^2-10x+2} \to \frac{1}{4}$

# When are limits undefined $\nexists$
limits are undefined logically when the left side and the right side don't approach each other, this can be seen in graphs such as $\frac{2}{x}$ as seen below.

 Limits don't exists at asymptotes,  that's why as a general rule if you plug in a value and get a constant over 0 ($\frac{c}{0} = \nexists$).
