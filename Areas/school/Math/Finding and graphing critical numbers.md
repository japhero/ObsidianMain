The base of a function $f(x)$ is the x position graph over point y while $f^\prime(x)$ is a function of the slope of $f(x)$ . 


## Step by step

### Finding the Critical numbers
because the first derivative is a function of the slope we can use the change in that function to get the critical numbers as they will be zeros of the graph as a change in a functions slope will create a zero on its derivative.

in this case the function of the slope $f(x)=x^2$ has a derivative of $2x$ the zeros of that function are zero this means that its critical number is zero this is then proven by the original graph as we can see a local min at the point zero



## Creating a table.
To find the meaning of the critical points we use the first derivative we create a table that holds a sort of number-line a list of intervals in between critical points. The table will typically be created as values in between those intervals  are passed into the function and weather they are positive are negative is decided

Because of the nature of the first derivative of a function:
Relative Maximum :  $f^\prime(x) = Positive \rightarrow f^\prime(x) = negative$ 
Relative Minimum: $f^\prime(x) = Negative \rightarrow f^\prime(x) = Positive$ 

## Sharp points
Any critical numbers created by the denominator being zero and making $f^\prime(x) = \require{cancel} \cancel{\exists}$ are sharp points and will apear as edges on the graph of $f(x)$ and as $\require{cancel} \cancel{\exists}$ at zero for $f^\prime(x)$
