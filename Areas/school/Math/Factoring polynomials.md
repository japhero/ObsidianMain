# Trinomials 

## Factor by grouping



## Factor when $a=1$
Factoring when $a=1$ simply means as for the basic definition of Trinomials ($ax^2+bx+c$ ) a has to be $1$ this can be done by factoring out a $GCF$ or simply given. 

**Step 1** 
Grab **B** and **C** these values are what we use to find the factors.

**Step 2** 
List factors of **C**, then evaluate if these factors add up to **B** if so these are your factors of $f(x)$.

**Step 3** 
Multiply your values by $-1$ then put them into Trinomial factored form $\left((x+a)(x+b) \right)$.
