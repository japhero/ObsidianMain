# Trinomials 
A **trinomial** is an algebraic expression that has three terms. Is typically found in the form $ax^2 +bx+c$.


## Factor when $a=1$
Factoring when $a=1$ simply means as for the basic definition of Trinomials ($ax^2+bx+c$ ) a has to be $1$ this can be done by factoring out a $GCF$ or simply given. 

**Step 1** 
Grab **B** and **C** these values are what we use to find the factors.

**Step 2** 
List factors of **C**, then evaluate if these factors add up to **B** if so these are your factors of $f(x)$ **(multiply to C add to B)**.


**Step 3** 
Multiply your values by $-1$ then put them into Trinomial factored form $\left((x+a)(x+b) \right)$ which is the product of 2 binomials.

## Factor by grouping
Factoring by grouping is an additional way to factor when we cant get the $a$ to have a coefficient of 1. For example using the "traditional" method it would be hard to factor an equation such as $4x^2+4x-15$. Factoring by grouping is another tool that lets us factor such equations. 

**Step 1**
The first step is similar to other methods in the sense that we have to find 2 numbers thats product is $a \cdot c$ and who's sum is $b$. 
$b_{1} *b_{2}=ac$
$b_{1}+b_{2} =b$

**Step 2**
The goal of step 1 is to give us a way to split $bx$ so that we can then factor each "half". To start this rewrite the equation, but write $bx$ as a sum of the 2 factors found $(b_{1},b_{2})$ with a coefficient of x . 
$$ax^2+bx+c \to ax^2+b_{1}x+b_{2}x+c$$
**Step 3** 
Its important to think of the new equation 2 somewhat separate parts that you manipulate separately $(ax^2 +b_{1}x) +(b_{2}x+c)$. The goal of the next operation is to have both haves have the same multiple but a different coefficient. Factor each "half" of the equations so that both halves have the same equation in the parentheses but a different coefficient.  
$$
(ax^2+b_{1}x) + (b_{2}x + c) =   f_{1}x \underbrace{(dx+e)}_{\text{one factor}} + f_{2}(dx+e)
$$

**Step 4**
The equation $f_{1}x (dx+e) + f_{2}(dx+e)$ contains all of the factors we just need to arrange them. We do this simply by factoring out $(dx+e)$. After doing this we get the answer.
$$
(f_{1}x+f_{2})(dx+e)
$$
