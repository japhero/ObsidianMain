# Trinomials 
A **trinomial** is an algebraic expression that has three terms. Is typically found in the form $ax^2 +bx+c$.


## Factor when $a=1$
Factoring when $a=1$ simply means as for the basic definition of Trinomials ($ax^2+bx+c$ ) a has to be $1$ this can be done by factoring out a $GCF$ or simply given. 

**Step 1** 
Grab **B** and **C** these values are what we use to find the factors.

**Step 2** 
List factors of **C**, then evaluate if these factors add up to **B** if so these are your factors of $f(x)$


**Step 3** 
Multiply your values by $-1$ then put them into Trinomial factored form $\left((x+a)(x+b) \right)$ which is the product of 2 binomials.

## Quadratic formula 
$$\frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{ b^2 -4ac}}}{2a}$$
