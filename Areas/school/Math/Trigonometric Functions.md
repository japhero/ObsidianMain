$\tan^{-1}(x) \not =1/\tan(x)$
arctan is really just the inverse of $\tan$.
the notation for arctangent is confusing as in other contexts it could be used to interpret the exponent of the function such as $\sin^{2}(x)$ where the exponent wouldn't represent the function change but the exponent. $\sin^2(x)=\sin(x)^2$


# Trigonometric Substitution
#workInProgress
## Why does it work?
The formulas of Trigonometric Substitution are substitutes because they do the same action as the trig function making them equal. The formulas are often similar to solving for a side of a triangle and can be derived from [[Pythagoras theorem]] $(a^2+b^2=c^2)$. [Further explanation](https://youtu.be/EV5dhv0A2wU?t=14)
## Formulas 
$$
\int \sqrt{ a^2-x^2 } \, dx  \to x= a\sin(\theta)
$$
$$
\int \sqrt{a^2+x^2 } \, dx  \to x = a\tan(\theta)
$$
$$
\int \sqrt{ x^2 -a^2} \, dx \to x= a\sec(\theta)
$$
