# DUMP
$\tan^{-1}(x) \not =1/\tan(x)$
arctan is really just the inverse of $\tan$.
the notation for arctangent is confusing as in other contexts it could be used to interpret the exponent of the function such as $\sin^{2}(x)$ where the exponent wouldn't represent the function change but the exponent. $\sin^2(x)=\sin(x)^2$
