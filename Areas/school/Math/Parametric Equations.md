# DUMP 
- Has 2 equations that represent the parametrics equation in terms of x and y so it can be then graphed as a combination of the 2 



### Arc length
- ARC length formula is a combination of the distance formula and general principals of integration.
- we use $\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}$ because as we integrate at an infinite scale $\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}$ operate as the change in $x$ and change in $y$ respectivly.
$$
\sqrt{ (\Delta x)^2 +(\Delta y)^2} \to \int_{a}^b \sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 }  \, dt 
$$


### Concavity
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac{\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
$$
- note that $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}$
