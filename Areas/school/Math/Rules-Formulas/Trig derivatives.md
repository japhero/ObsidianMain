# Cos 
$\frac d {dx}\cos(x)=-\sin(x)$

# Sin 
$\frac d {dx} \sin(x) = \cos(x)$

# Tan 
$\frac d {dx} \tan(x) = \sec^2(x)$

# Cot
$\frac d {dx} \cot(x) = \csc^2(x)$

# Sec
$\frac d {dx} \sec(x) = \sec(x)\tan(x)$

# Csc  
$\frac d {dx} \csc(x) = -\csc(x)\cot(x)$

# Constants 
$$\sin(ax)=a\cos(5x)$$
The rule of multiplying the constant and also keeping the value in the parentheses is adherence to the  [[chain rule]].  This also functions for all trig derivatives $\sin(x)$ was just taken as an example

# Tips to remember
- All trig functions starting with the letter $c$ are negative such as $cos$ and $cot$ 
- when trying to remember $tan$ or $sec$ and you want the derivative of their inverse cot or sec just replace the original with their inverse. For example $\tan = \sec^2, cot = csc^2$. so all we have to remember is $tan$ and we automatically know $cot$ because $sec$ turns into its inverse $csc$. (NOT TRUE LOL)
