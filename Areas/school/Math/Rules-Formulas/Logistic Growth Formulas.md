## Logistic Differential Equation
$$
\frac{dp}{dt}=kP\left( 1-\frac{P}{M} \right)
$$
Where $k$ is the growth of population $P$ up to  carrying  capacity $M$.

## Logistic equation

$$
P(t)=\frac{M}{1+Ae^{-kt}} \text{ where } A =\frac{M-P_{0}}{P_{0}}
$$
, and  where $k$ is the growth of population $P$ up to  carrying  capacity $M$.


&emsp;
## Law of Natural Growth 
$$
\frac{dp}{dt}=kP
$$
Where $k$ is again the growth of population $P$.
