# Constant Rule
$$ \int  \, a \frac{d}{dx} = ax +c $$

---

# Constant multiple rule
$$\int  \, ax \frac{d}{dx} = a\int  \, x\frac{d}{dx}  $$
You can extract constants out of the integral 

---
# Sum Rule
$$\int  \,( f(x) + g(x)) \frac{d}{dx} = \int  \, f(x) \frac{d}{dx} + \int  \, g(x) \frac{d}{dx}  $$
Different integrals when added can be done separately

---
# Exponent Rule
$$\int  \, x^a \frac{d}{dx} = \frac{x^{a+1}}{a+1} +C$$

---
# Reciprocal Rule
$$\int  \, \frac{1}{x}dx = \ln(x)+C$$

---
# Exponential Function Rule
$$\int  \, e^x dx = e^x +C$$
$f^{'}(e^x) = e^x$  same shit

---
# Trig Rule (sin)

$$\int  \, \sin(x) dx = -\cos(x)+C $$
basically just normal [[Trig derivatives]] but applied inversely 
# Trig rule (cos)

$$\int  \, \cos(x)dx = \sin(x) +C$$

---
# Special exponent Integral
$$\int a^x \, dx = \frac{a^x}{\ln(a)}$$
