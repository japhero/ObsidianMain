Rule
$$\frac {d} {dx} \left[ \frac {f(x)} {g(x)} \right] = \frac{g(x)f^\prime(x) - g^\prime (x)f(x)}{g(x)^2} $$
Make sure its the Derivative of the $top * bottom$ not that you get the get the derivative of the $bottom$ first because that would flip the numerator because of the $-$ sign.


# Rule with constant numerator
A common occurrence is we are presented with a quotient rule were the numerator is constant such as $\frac{10}{x}$ in this situation we can rewrite this by changing the exponent of $x$ to be negative: $10x^{-1}$ now that we have a number we can perform the [[Derivative Product rule|product rule]] with and remembering that constants in product rules dont effect the derivative as $f=(4x) \rightarrow f' =4*x'$. So finally we get $$-\frac{10}{x^2} = -10x^{-2}$$
## Constant formula 
- $C$ = constant

$$f(x)=\frac{c}{x} \rightarrow f'(x)= -cx^{-2}, -\frac{c}{x^2}$$

Again the transformation is mainly done through manipulating negative exponents.
