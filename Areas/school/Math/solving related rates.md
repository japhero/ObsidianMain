- make a formula solving for what you know
- take the derivative of that with respect to time $\frac{dx}{dt}$
- kind of similar to [[Implicit derivatives]] because we need to handle the relationships of different derivatives. Its like handling ][[Implicit derivatives]] but in a form of [[systems of equations]]
- Use $\tan(\theta)$ when get a relationship between $\frac y x$ on a triangle because $\tan(\theta)$ is that relationship represented relative to $\theta$   
- [Conical tank](https://youtu.be/ps-r4nti5Go?t=3022)
	- use a ratio based on the original inputs when trying to formulate in terms of h 
	- example would be if the dimensions of tank are $H =24, R =6, H=\frac {24} 6 r$ or $H = 4r$
- Read the problem several times lol
- Some times when using [[Pythagoreans Theorem]] to solve for triangles one must first solve for a side as a way to eliminate variables. Of course remember to solve at the target position for example if its asking to find some rate at $y=6$ make sure to only use the result of that calculation at $y = 6$ 
- make sure that you evenly distribute exponents  according to the [[Exponent Product rule]] for example $\left( \frac 1 3 x \right)^2$ distributed is $\frac 1 9 x^2$.
