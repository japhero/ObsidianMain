# DUMP
- make a formula solving for what you know
- take the derivative of that with respect to time $\frac{dx}{dt}$
- kind of similar to [[Implicit derivatives]] because we need to handle the relationships of different derivatives. Its like handling ][[Implicit derivatives]] but in a form of [[systems of equations]]
