- $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$
	- after $f(x)$ is applied $f^{-1}(x)$ inverts the results back to x 
- $f'(x)=\frac{1}{g^{'}(f(x))}$
- inverse of $(a,b)$ is $(b,a)$ for example $(-4,15) \rightarrow (15,-4)$

> First step to solving the identity $\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$ is to find $f^{-1}(x)$. Logically to solve this we need to plug in our x value so $-4$. So starting we have $f^{-1}(-4)$ this equation can be solved because the answer is already given considering that $(-4,0)$ is a valid point on the graph of $g(x)$ we know that $g(-4)= 0$.

To take the derivative of $f(x)$ we just apply basic chain rules, resulting in $f^{'}(x)=5x^4+6x^2+1$. Next we plug in 0 for x so $f'(0)$ this results in $f^{'}(0)=1$ giving us a slope of $\frac{1}{1},1$.

# Using the  "[[Derivatives of inverse functions#Identity|identity]]"
The identity is the formula $[f^{-1}(x)]^{'}=\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$ it allows us to solve for derivatives of inverse functions because we can solve without having to find the function of $^{'}[f^{-1}(x)]$. Instead, you can just find $f^{-1}(x)$ as seen in the [[Derivatives of inverse functions#Identity|formula]].
