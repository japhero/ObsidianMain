- Disk method entails 2 formulas.
	- $\pi \int_{a}^b [f(x)]^2\, dx$
	- $\pi \int^b_{a} \left( [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 \right) \, dx$
	- thickness = $dx$
	- outer function - inner function
- when taking the integral of the functions its easier to foil out the function.
- $$\pi \int_{a}^b ([\mid f(x)-  D \mid \,]^2 -[\mid g(x)-  D\mid \,]^2)\, dx $$
	- were $D$ is the distance to the line of pivot.
	- Practically we wont apply the absolute value similarly to [[Definite integrals]] because its impossible to assume that state for a whole function so we will differentiate in between $[D-f(x)]$ and $[f(x)-D]$ not $[\mid f(x)- D \mid \,]$
	- when using washer method we must remember that for rotating across functions an axis of x or y the function must be in terms of the transfer fucntion for example if rotating across $x=1$ it has to be a function of $x$. 
	- "For the disk/washer method we integrate along the axis parallel to the axis of rotation."
	- $$
2\pi\int_{a}^b (\mid r -d \mid)(f(x)-g(x)) \, dx 
$$
remember that its really representing
$$
2\pi \int_{a}^b (radius)(height) \, dx 
$$

- When you have a function of a line plug in that value not the total area of that function as its found when taking the integral.
	- For example if you have $-x^2+2$ bound by $y=1$ and $x=0$ remember that to represent the "square" of the function dont use  the area ($1*1$) use the value of that function so $1$. This is because we need to remember that in this case we get the area when we integrate and the limits of integration decide the "width" in this case of the function (because its the line value * x) theoretically you could calculate the area and separate it out but that would be the same as doing $\int_{a}^b a-b \, dx = \int^b_{a} a \, dx -\int^b_{a} b \, dx$
