- Disk method entails 2 formulas.
	- $\pi \int_{a}^b [f(x)]^2\, dx$
	- $\pi \int^b_{a} \left( [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 \right) \, dx$
	- thickness = $dx$
	- outer function - inner function
- when taking the integral of the functions its easier to foil out the function.
- $$\pi \int_{a}^b ([f(x)- \mid D \mid \,]^2 -[g(x)- \mid D\mid \,]^2)\, dx $$
	- were $D$ is the distance to the line of pivot.
	- Practically we wont apply the absolute value similarly to [[Definite integrals]] because its impossible to assume that state for a whole function so we will differentiate in between $[D-f(x)]$ and $[f(x)-D]$ not $[f(x)-\mid D \mid \,]$
	- when using washer method we must remember that for rotating across functions an axis of x or y the function must be in terms of the transfer fucntion for example if rotating across $x=1$ it has to be a function of $x$. 
	- "For the disk/washer method we integrate along the axis parallel to the axis of rotation."
