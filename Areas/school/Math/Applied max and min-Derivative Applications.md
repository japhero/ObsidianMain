- Similar to [[solving related rates|related rates]] in how we apply formulas

## HW 44 mistakes/takeaways 
- setup is very important.
- Check what steps you need to take [[integration rules|integrate]] or [[Derivative Quotient rule|derivate]] 
- Sometimes using $f^{''}(x)$ to prove that something is a max is way easier than doing the [[First and second derivative test|first derivative test]]. 
- Remember to look at what your solving for. For example if you want to get area don't try to solve for the x variable in that equation do it in the other systems of equations.
- Remember that the equation with the given value is often the equation that we uses to get definitions or as a helper function
- [[Derivative Quotient rule#Constant formula|Quotent rule CONSTANTS]]

[[U-Substitution]]



## HW 45
- Had to use old formulas (quotient and product) Maby learn better methods of simplification 

## HW 47
- When we have a book problem with page margins **allways foil the printed area formula** to make calculation much easier


## PipeLine question
