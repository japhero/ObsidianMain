- We learn the 
	- Chemical structure of water
	- What polarity 
- Water is composed of $H_{2}O$ 2:1 ratio between hydrogen and oxygen
- Covalent bond means that the atoms share electrons although the sharing is not equal as  the oxygen is more electronegative than the hydrogen therefore making the sharing unequal.
- Covalent bonds result can in polarity

- When different molecules form hydrogen bonds we call this adhesion

- Surface tension is the result if increased hydrogen bonding forces between water and molecules at the surface
- **Water properites**
	- Water is not a universal solvent but does have very high solvent property
	- Waters cohesive bonds allow water to change its density throught the  hydrogen  bonds making the ice float.
	- Water can maintain a lot of heat energy before changing chemical states.
	- Capillary action is the result  of adhesive and cohesive bonds of water allowing it to move
	- 

## [Summary lesson #2 8/26](https://virtualvirginia.instructure.com/courses/18058/pages/m1-library-summary-videos-and-resources-8-slash-22-9-slash-15?module_item_id=5157179) 

- Water is a polar molecule again because the electrons are shared unequally giving it a positive and a negative end.
- These properties allow it to bond with other molecules that are polar as opposites attract.
- Water can bond to itself and this bond because the molecule is the same is called a cohesive bond.
	- These bonds are relatively weak 
	- Thats where the lattice structure comes from the bonding 
- You get more hydrogen bonds on the top of  the water thats why you have surface tension

- nutrons contribute to mass but not to charge
- electrons are smaller inmass than protons
- its customary to ignore the mass of electrons
- **Atomic Number** is the number  of protons in an  atom
- Number of nutrons changes resultinging in  isotopes
- **Atomic mass** is  the mean mass for its naturally occurring isotopes
- Bohr model
	- Electrons fill orbitals in a consistnt order they start witht the orbitals closest to the nucleaus and and fill each orbial continually
	- THe innermost shell has a max of two electrons but the next two electron shells  can have 8, this is known as the octet rule.
	- the electrons  in the outermost level determin the stability of the atom
	- What are valence shells?
	- All elements are the most stable when the outermost shell  is filled with electrons according to the octet rule. This is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable. However, since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, atoms form chemical bonds basically taking the electrons they need to  stay stable and taking them from  another causing a bond.

## [Textbook 2.2](https://openstax.org/books/biology-ap-courses/pages/2-2-water)
- hydrophilic means you love having bonds with water this  usually happnes  with  polar molecules. On the otherhand hydrophobic substances are things  such as  oil which dont bond very well with water
- Water is a solvent because  it  disolves a lot of stuff adding not water shit to  water is called the sphere of hydrogen
- Ice is formed when crystals in water harden creating the  ice
	- Ice is less dense than water
==Special properties of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive properties, and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of pH.==

**Heat of vaporization** is the amount  of energy required to change one gram of liquid to gass

**Evaporation** is when individual molecules change into gases

**Solvent's** are  substances that are capable of dissolving other polar molecules

The **Sphere of hydration** is a sphere of oxygen molecules that surround the charged molecules

Ionic compounds reacting with polar regions of water molecules and then disrupting the ionic bonds is called **dissociation.**

When two of the same molecules form hydrogen bonds we call this **cohesion**  
![|350](https://i.imgur.com/u5JbozW.png)

Covalent bonds between the oxygen of one water molecule and the hydrogen of another water molecule are responsible for the adhesive properties of water or the fact that water sticks to itself.


**What are hydroxyl groups?**
