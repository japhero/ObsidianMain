# Notes


## Carbon

| Atomic number    | 6         |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Atomic mass      | 12.01 amu |
| Chemical Formula |           |

&emsp;

- The element carbon 
	- 4 valence electrons
	- carbon can bond to oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen 
- Carbon and hydrogen can form either hydrocarbon chains or rings.
- Carbon is the backbone of of macromolecules
- Single Carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell with an atomic number of 6.
- 

## definitions 

**Valence electrons**
- The electrons on the outermost shell and the electrons that can contribute the to the formation of chemical bonds

**Macromolecules** 
- The molecules that make up cells are called macromolecules, proteins, nucleic acids, (DNA and RNA) and lipids are examples of macromolecules. Macromolecules are also considered a subset of organic molecules and defined as ==any carbon-containing liquid, solid or gas that is especially important for life.== 
- Types of macromolecules
	- proteins
	- lipids
	- carbohydrates
	- nucleic acids

**Atomic Number** is the number  of protons in an  atom

 Number of nutrons changes resultinging in  isotopes
 
**Atomic mass** is  the mean mass for its naturally occurring isotopes



## Functional Groups
**Functional groups** are groups of atoms that give specific properties to hydrocarbon chains or rings that define their overall chemical characteristics. Some examples are 
1. $-\text{CH}_{3}$ (methyl group)
2. $-\text{COOH}$ (carboxyl group) 
Attaching different functional groups produces different effects such as  $-\text{COOH}$ (carboxyl) which makes a molecule more acidic. Other functional groups such as amine groups make molecules more basic. 

[[#Functional Groups]]  are found along the "carbon backbone" of [[#Macromolecule|Macromolecules]] 




## Hydrocarbons 
Hydrocarbons are organic molecules containing carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons are special because they have a large amount of covalent bonds between the the atoms in hydrocarbons allowing them to store large amounts of energy as seen in its form as propane or butane in a lighter. All of their energy is released when you burn/oxidize them. Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon and has a central as the location of the atoms is determined by the shape of its electron orbitals. Methane has the shape of a tetrahedron.

### Hydrocarbon chains 
Hydrocarbon chains are formed by successive bonds between carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, theymay be branched or unbranched. Furthermore, the overall geometry of the molecule is altered by the different geometries of single, double, and triple covalent bonds.

Note that the prefix eth- for example shows that it contains carbon hydrocarbons.  The suffixes “-ane,” “-ene,” and “-yne” refer to single double or triple carbon bonds. Propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules, butane, butene, and butyne for four carbon molecules, and so on.


### Hydrocarbon rings 
- Carbon makes things organic
- They from a variety of shapes depending on how many carbon molecules there are
- Covalent bonds are what holds the rings together

## Isomers 
**Isomers** are molecules that have the same molecular formula (the same number of atoms) but different molecular structures. Do not confuse these with isotopes.

**Structural isomers** differ in their placement of their covalent bonds and although they can have the same atoms they will have different chemical properties. **Geometric isomers** have similar placement of their covalent bonds but differ in how those bonds are made to the surrounding atoms. 



##  Cis and Trans Functional groups
*Cis* and *trans*  configurations describe the orientation that the isomers have in space.

***Cis*** [[#Functional Groups]] are on the same side  of the double bond.

***Trans*** [[#Functional Groups]] are  on opposite sides of the double bond.

## Enantiomers
**Enantiomers** are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three-dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images.
