1. What are the different ways to describe relatively tonicity of environments?
2. How do differences in osmolarity impact of the movement of water in a cell?
3. How do the constant movement do molecules across a membrane maintain growth and homeostasis?
4. What is osmoregulation and how does it contribute to the health and survival of organisms? 

---
- Osmosis is the diffusion of free water across "selectively permeable membrane"
	- Uses aquaporins
- Osmolarity is the total solute concentration in a solution
- Tonicity is the measurement of the a solute between two solutions. 
- Hypertonic
	- More solute less solvent
	- water out of cell
- Isotonic
	- Equal concentrations of both
	- Flaccid condition
- Hypotonic 
	- Less solute and more solvent
	- Turgid
	- water -> cell
- Water moves into the place with a higher solute concentration 
- **Basically solutions try to reach equilibrium if possible**
- osmosis maintains balance and control of solute

1. What are the components of an effective graph?
2. what are different types of graphs?
3. When should graphs be used?

---

- Things that matter
	- Title should be accurate and descriptive
	- ID variable -> X-axis
	- D Variable -> Y-axis
	- Scale should be uniform and large enough to match the data
	- Identafiable lines or bars (Legend)
	- Trend line (line of best fit)
- Types of graph
	- Line graph
		- trends over time
		- Changes over time
	- Scatterplot
		- Determine relationships
	- Histogram
		- compares values in dataset 
		- relatinship between 2 variables
	- Box and wisker plot
		- Compares distributions
		-
