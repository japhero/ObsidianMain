## Unit 6 contents overview notes

1. DNA & RNA Structure
	1. Need to know the difference between DNA and RNA
	2. Need to understand the difference between prokaryote and eukaryotes in  the context of DNA  
2. Replication
	1. How its replicated
		-  Exposes the nitrogen bases and uses enzymes to make a direct copy of the DNA strand
	2. 
3. Transcription and translation
	1. includes RNA processing
	2. transcription is where we take  the DNA and turn it into RNA wearas  translation is where i take the RNA and create a protein  
	- [[Eukaryotic Gene Transcription]]
4. Gene regulation
	1. eukaryotes do a lot more for this step than prokaryotes 
	2. prokaryotes use operators and promoters
5. Cell specialization
	1. this is largly about how genes are regulated into creating specialized versions of themselves. 
6. [[Gene Mutations]] 
	1. external factors do mutation aswell as internal errors
	2. point  mutation  vs frameshift
	
7. Biotechnology
