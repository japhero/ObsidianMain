### **Dehydration Synthesis** (Put tother while losing water)
-  its a type of reaction that creates macromolecules
- The byproduct is **Water.**

1. The subcomponents of water disconnect ($H$ and $OH$)
2. The monomers bond through a covalent bond 
3. The Water molecule$(H_{2}O)$ rejoins the two already connected monomers

### **Hydrolysis Reactions** (Split with water)
 - Polymers are hydrolyzed/broken down into monomers
 - A water molecule is also broken down into its components and distributed among the different monomers.

| Polymer      | Monomer        |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Carbohydrate | Monosaccharide |
| Lipid        | Fatty acid     |
| Nucleic Acid | Nucleotide     |

- Monomers are chemical  subunits used to create polymers
-  A polymer is a macromolecule made of many monomers

- Covalent bonds are what connects monomers in polymers
- Monomers have specific chemical properties and the **Polymers** are specfic to the monomer.

# [Ap Daily 1.4](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/home?apd=hwx3npfwqp)
- Structure is related to function 
- Change in structure results in change in function
- **Nucleic acids**
	- Is a polymer composed of nucleotide monomers
![|200](https://i.imgur.com/2rTvr1P.png)
- DNA and RNA are examples of nucleic acids



# [AP Daily  1.5 video 1-3](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/home?apd=m1h1phx4h0&unitId=1)

## Video 1
-  Directionality and how does it influence the structure and synthesis of nucleic acid polymers
- How can a change in the subunits of a nucleic acid polymer change the function or structure

- Linear sequence of all nucleotides has a $3'$ hydroxyl and a $5'$ phosphate of the sugar in the nucleotide.
- DNA is a nucleic acid polymer containing two strands, each strand in an antiparallel 5'-3' direction.
	- Basically they switch directions after each strand. 
- Adenine and thymine are held by 2 hydrogen bonds 
- Guanine and cytosine are held by 3 hydrogen bonds
	- The more bonds the more stable the molecule 
- The linear structure of nucleotides encodes biological information
-

- Any change to the sequence changes the encoded information.
- During synthesis nucleotides can only be added to the 3' end.
	- Covalent bonds are used


## **Video 3**
Topic
- Directionality of the subunits of carbohydrates
- How does a change in the subunits effect to changes of its structure or function.

- Carbohydrates comprises of linear changes of sugar monomers connected by covalent bonds 
- even small directional changes can result in functional difference
- [[Carbohydrates]] can be linear or branched 
![|200](https://i.imgur.com/b2O4A4b.png)
- similar structure means similar function thats why for example glycogen and starch have a similar function because of their similar structure
	-  Starch = energy in plants, glycogen = energy in humans
- cellulose because of its rigid strucutre functions as a structual element.

# Lipids 
- Also sources of energy that powers cells
- Composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen but is arranged differently than [[Carbohydrates]].
- Nonpolar and hydrophobic (cant desolve in water)
- Lipids are non-polar becaue they are hydrocarbons 
- Includes
	- Fats
	- Oils
	- Waxes
	- phospholipids
	- Steroids

### Guiding questions 
- What are the four major types of lipids?
	- Fats 
	- Waxes
	- phospholipids
	- Steroids
- What are functions of fats in living organisms?
	- Fats are useful in cells for longterm energy storage
- What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids?
	- Saturated fats are fats that have single bonds between neighboring carbon 
- What is the molecular structure of phospholipids, and what is the role of phospholipids in cells?
	- Fatty acid chains attached to a membrane.
- What is the basic structure of a steroid, and what are examples of their functions?
	- Fused ring structure
	- helps emulsify fats 
- How does cholesterol help maintain the fluid nature of the plasma membrane of cells?

## Fats and Oils
- Fats are usefull in cells for longterm energy storage
- Lipids provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals. 
	- The hydrofobic nature for example can create a dry layer for animals
- Fat consists of glycerol and fatty acids.
- arent fatty acids the monomer of lipids?
- Fatty acidshave a ling chain of  hydrocarbons to which a carboxylgroupis attached, hence the name "fatty acid".
- Fatty acid can have 4-36 carbon atoms, most commonly having 12-18

> How fats are formed

- During the process of fats forming 3 water molecules are relesaed.
- Fats can also be called **triacylglycerols** or **triglycerides** because of their chemical structure.
- Fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated  
	- Saturated fats are fats that have single bonds between neighboring carbon 
<img src = "https://useruploads.socratic.org/mqa0gFxXSfuTHia3Zn8q_saturated_vs_unsaturated_lipids.jpg" height =200>
- Most unsaturated fats are oils
- one Double bond means monounsaturated fats and more than one is a polyunsaturated fat.
- [[Carbon#Cis and Trans Functional groups|Cis and trans]] indicate the orientation around the double bond, so if the fats are oriented in a way where the polymer is a chain we call this a **cis fat** whereas a **trans** fat is one thats orientated so that its straight.

### Omega Fatty Acids 
- Fatty acids arent produced by the human body but are still required meaning we need to eat to get them. **Omega-3 fatty acids** are some of those fats meaning humans require them but dont produce them.

## Waxes 
- Hydrophobic therefore used on plants and other surfaces to avoid water
- made of long fatty acid chains ==esterified== into long chain alchohols.

## Phospholipids 
- Large part of the plasma membrane in a cells outer layer
- Made of fatty acid chains attached to glycerol or sphingosine.
- Instead of being atached in triglycerides they are attached to pairs called diacylglycerol.

- A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part.

## Steroids
-  Fused ring structure
- Are grouped with the other lipids because they are hydrophobic 
- cortisol is the most common steroid
