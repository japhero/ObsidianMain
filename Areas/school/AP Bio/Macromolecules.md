| Polymer      | Monomer        |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Carbohydrate | Monosaccharide |
| Lipid        | Fatty acid     |
| Nucleic Acid | Nucleotide     |
| Protein      | Amino Acid     |

- Monomers are chemical  subunits used to create polymers
-  A polymer is a macromolecule made of many monomers
![](https://i.imgur.com/byZveyc.png)
- Covalent bonds are what connects monomers in polymers
- Monomers have specific chemical properties and the **Polymers** are specfic to the monomer.

### **Dehydration Synthesis** (Put tother while losing water)
-  its a type of reaction that creates macromolecules
- The byproduct is **Water.**

1. The subcomponents of water disconnect ($H$ and $OH$)
2. The monomers bond through a covalent bond 
3. The Water molecule$(H_{2}O)$ rejoins the two already connected monomers

### **Hydrolysis Reactions** (Split with water)
 - Polymers are hydrolyzed/broken down into monomers
 - A water molecule is also broken down into its components and distributed among the different monomers.

# [Ap Daily 1.4](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/home?apd=hwx3npfwqp)
- Structure is related to function 
- Change in structure results in change in function
- **Nucleic acids**
	- Is a polymer composed of nucleotide monomers
![|200](https://i.imgur.com/2rTvr1P.png)
- DNA and RNA are examples of nucleic acids
**Proteins**
- Proteins have monomers called Amino acids 
- Amino acids have directionality with a $(NH2)$ end and a $(COOH)$ end
![|200](https://i.imgur.com/GXF83ox.png)
- A polypeptide is the primary structure of a protein considiting of an order of amino acids and determines the overall shape of the protein 
![|400](https://i.imgur.com/QoLv2Hj.png)
> both polypeptieds will have different shapes because of the  configuration of their monomers

- **R** group are a group of atoms at the center of an amino acid  attached to the central carbon it can be hydrophobic, hydrophilic or ionic
	- This group decides the chemical properties of that protein.


# [AP Daily  1.5 video 1-3](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/home?apd=m1h1phx4h0&unitId=1)

## Video 1
-  Directionality and how does it influence the structure and synthesis of nucleic acid polymers
- How can a change in the subunits of a nucleic acid polymer change the function or structure

- Linear sequence of all nucleotides has a $3'$ hydroxyl and a $5'$ phosphate of the sugar in the nucleotide.
- DNA is a nucleic acid polymer containing two strands, each strand in an antiparallel 5'-3' direction.
	- Basically they switch directions after each strand. 
- Adenine and thymine are held by 2 hydrogen bonds 
- Guanine and cytosine are held by 3 hydrogen bonds
	- The more bonds the more stable the molecule 
- The linear structure of nucleotides encodes biological information
- 
![|300](https://i.imgur.com/VVQfXY3.png)
- Any change to the sequence changes the encoded information.
- During synthesis nucleotides can only be added to the 3' end.
	- Covalent bonds are used
## **video 2**
- Proteins start and end with either an amino group or a carboxyl group.
	- This gives the amino acid directionality
- Amino acids are connected by the formation of covalent bonds at the carboxyl end of the now growing peptide chain.
- 4 elements of protein structure
	1.  Primary structure is determined by the sequence of amino acids held together by the covalent bonds called peptide bonds
	2. Secondary structure arises through local folding of the amino acid chain into elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets
	3. Tertiary structure is the overall 3D shape of the protein and often minimizes free energy; Various types of bonds and interactions stabilize the protein at this level. Happens particularly through bonds found with R groups.
	4. Quaternary structure arises from the interactions between multiple polypeptide units.

- Receptor proteins are responsible for receiving signals.
-  remember that polar R groups are hydrophilic and non-polar R groups are hydrophobic 

## **Video 3**
Topic
- Directionality of the subunits of carbohydrates
- How does a change in the subunits effect to changes of its structure or function.

- Carbohydrates comprises of linear changes of sugar monomers connected by covalent bonds 
- even small directional changes can result in functional difference
- [[Carbohydrates]] can be linear or branched 
![|200](https://i.imgur.com/b2O4A4b.png)
- similar structure means similar function thats why for example glycogen and starch have a similar function because of their similar structure
	-  Starch = energy in plants, glycogen = energy in humans
- cellulose because of its rigid strucutre functions as a structual element.

# Lipids 
- Also sources of energy that powers cells
- Composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen but is arranged differently than [[Carbohydrates]].
- Nonpolar and hydrophobic (cant desolve in water)
- Lipids are non-polar becaue they are hydrocarbons 
- Includes
	- Fats
	- Oils
	- Waxes
	- phospholipids
	- Steroids

### Guiding questions 
- What are the four major types of lipids?
	- Fats 
	- Waxes
	- phospholipids
	- Steroids
- What are functions of fats in living organisms?
	- Fats are useful in cells for longterm energy storage
- What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids?
	- Saturated fats are fats that have single bonds between neighboring carbon 
- What is the molecular structure of phospholipids, and what is the role of phospholipids in cells?
	- Fatty acid chains attached to a membrane.
- What is the basic structure of a steroid, and what are examples of their functions?
	- Fused ring structure
	- helps emulsify fats 
- How does cholesterol help maintain the fluid nature of the plasma membrane of cells?

## Fats and Oils
- Fats are usefull in cells for longterm energy storage
- Lipids provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals. 
	- The hydrofobic nature for example can create a dry layer for animals
- Fat consists of glycerol and fatty acids.
- arent fatty acids the monomer of lipids?
- Fatty acidshave a ling chain of  hydrocarbons to which a carboxylgroupis attached, hence the name "fatty acid".
- Fatty acid can have 4-36 carbon atoms, most commonly having 12-18

> How fats are formed

- During the process of fats forming 3 water molecules are relesaed.
- Fats can also be called **triacylglycerols** or **triglycerides** because of their chemical structure.
- Fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated  
	- Saturated fats are fats that have single bonds between neighboring carbon 
<img src = "https://useruploads.socratic.org/mqa0gFxXSfuTHia3Zn8q_saturated_vs_unsaturated_lipids.jpg" height =200>
- Most unsaturated fats are oils
- one Double bond means monounsaturated fats and more than one is a polyunsaturated fat.
- [[Carbon#Cis and Trans Functional groups|Cis and trans]] indicate the orientation around the double bond, so if the fats are oriented in a way where the polymer is a chain we call this a **cis fat** whereas a **trans** fat is one thats orientated so that its straight.

### Omega Fatty Acids 
- Fatty acids arent produced by the human body but are still required meaning we need to eat to get them. **Omega-3 fatty acids** are some of those fats meaning humans require them but dont produce them.

## Waxes 
- Hydrophobic therefore used on plants and other surfaces to avoid water
- made of long fatty acid chains ==esterified== into long chain alchohols.

## Phospholipids 
- Large part of the plasma membrane in a cells outer layer
- Made of fatty acid chains attached to glycerol or sphingosine.
- Instead of being atached in triglycerides they are attached to pairs called diacylglycerol.
![400](https://i.imgur.com/2nLUSyg.png)
- A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part.

## Steroids
-  Fused ring structure
- Are grouped with the other lipids because they are hydrophobic 
- cortisol is the most common steroid
