- Can you describe protein structure?
- Can you identify how enzymes function on substrates based on structure?
- Can you use models to predict and justify how changes in subcomponents (and bonds) of a biological polymer (enzyme) can affect the functionality of the molecule?

- Enzymes speed up chemical relations
- Act as a facilitator to guide chemical reactions
- They lower activation energy

- Enzymes are catalysts 
- activation energy is the amount of energy required for the reactants to turn into the products
- Large activation energies take longer while smaller activation energies take less time.
- **Active sites** are a grove on the enzyme where a substrate binds
- **Substrate** binds to an enzyme at the active site and is one of the reactants.
	- this can be described like a lock and a key, an enzyme can only be used for a certain catalyst. The shape of the enzyme therefore being very important.
- Enzymes are reusable and after a reaction it will "look" for another reaction.

- An enzyme can denature or change shape if it finds itself in environments with a suboptimal temperature or PH.

**Proteins**
- Proteins have monomers called Amino acids 
- Amino acids have directionality with a $(NH2)$ end and a $(COOH)$ end

- A polypeptide is the primary structure of a protein considering of an order of amino acids and determines the overall shape of the protein

> both polypeptides will have different shapes because of the  configuration of their monomers

- **R** group are a group of atoms at the center of an amino acid  attached to the central carbon it can be hydrophobic, hydrophilic or ionic
	- This group decides the chemical properties of that protein.

## **video 2**
- Proteins start and end with either an amino group or a carboxyl group.
	- This gives the amino acid directionality
- Amino acids are connected by the formation of covalent bonds at the carboxyl end of the now growing peptide chain.
- 4 elements of protein structure
	1.  Primary structure is determined by the sequence of amino acids held together by the covalent bonds called peptide bonds
	2. Secondary structure arises through local folding of the amino acid chain into elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets
	3. Tertiary structure is the overall 3D shape of the protein and often minimizes free energy; Various types of bonds and interactions stabilize the protein at this level. Happens particularly through bonds found with R groups.
	4. Quaternary structure arises from the interactions between multiple polypeptide units.

- Receptor proteins are responsible for receiving signals.
-  remember that polar R groups are hydrophilic and non-polar R groups are hydrophobic
