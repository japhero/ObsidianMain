- Can you describe protein structure?
- Can you identify how enzymes function on substrates based on structure?
- Can you use models to predict and justify how changes in subcomponents (and bonds) of a biological polymer (enzyme) can affect the functionality of the molecule?

- Enzymes speed up chemical relations
- Act as a facilitator to guide chemical reactions
- They lower activation energy

- Enzymes are catalysts 
- activation energy is the amount of energy required for the reactants to turn into the products
- Large activation energies take longer while smaller activation energies take less time.
- **Active sites** are a grove on the enzyme where a substrate binds
- **Substrate** binds to an enzyme at the active site and is one of the reactants.
	- this can be described like a lock and a key, an enzyme can only be used for a certain catalyst. The shape of the enzyme therefore being very important.
- Enzymes are reusable and after a reaction it will "look" for another reaction.

- An enzyme can denature or change shape if it finds itself in environments with a suboptimal temperature or PH.

**Proteins**
- Proteins have monomers called Amino acids 
- Amino acids have directionality with a $(NH2)$ end and a $(COOH)$ end

- A polypeptide is the primary structure of a protein considiting of an order of amino acids and determines the overall shape of the protein

> both polypeptieds will have different shapes because of the  configuration of their monomers

- **R** group are a group of atoms at the center of an amino acid  attached to the central carbon it can be hydrophobic, hydrophilic or ionic
	- This group decides the chemical properties of that protein.
