- Can you describe protein structure?
- Can you identify how enzymes function on substrates based on structure?
- Can you use models to predict and justify how changes in subcomponents (and bonds) of a biological polymer (enzyme) can affect the functionality of the molecule?


# 8/30 Lesson
- Enzymes speed up chemical relations
- Act as a facilitator to guide chemical reactions
- They lower activation energy

- Enzymes are catalysts 
- activation energy is the amount of energy required for the reactants to turn into the products
- Large activation energies take longer while smaller activation energies take less time.
- **Active sites** are a grove on the enzyme where a substrate binds
- **Substrate** binds to an enzyme at the active site and is one of the reactants.
	- this can be described like a lock and a key, an enzyme can only be used for a certain catalyst. The shape of the enzyme therefore being very important.
- Enzymes are reusable and after a reaction it will "look" for another reaction.

- An enzyme can denature or change shape if it finds itself in environments with a suboptimal temperature or PH.
