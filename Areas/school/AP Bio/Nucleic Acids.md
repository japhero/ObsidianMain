- Chemical bonds that stabilize the complementary nitrogen bases into a double helix are **hydrogen bonds.** 
- Covalent bonds join one nucleotide to another on strands of DNA 
- **mRNA** forms base pairs with DNA as it is polymerized and then takes the new code out of the nucleus of the cell.
	- M stands for messenger DNA
- Transcription of the DNA occurs in the nucleus of the cell.
- and of course nucleotides are the monomer of [[Nucleic Acids]]
- Each Nucleotide is made up of a sugar a phosphate group and a nitrogen base.

- what are the differences between the polymers DNA and RNA
- Both are assembeled from nucleotide subuinits which contain a
	1. 5 carbon sugar
	2. Phosphate group
	3. NItrogen Base
- Each monomer is then connected in a chain like fasion through covalent bonds forming the sugar phosphate backbone  
- Each linear strand has directionality with either a 5' or a 3' end
- DNA contians deoxyribose sugar and RNA contains ribose
	- They differ slightly in the subunits.
- Uracil is only found in RNA  wears Thymine is only found in  DNA
- RNA usually has 1 strand wear as DNA usualy has 2 and runs anti paralell
