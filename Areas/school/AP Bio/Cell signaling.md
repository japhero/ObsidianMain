## Signal Transduction

### [Ap Video 4.2.1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=ooi7e9brze&status=assigned)
1. What is signal transduction?
	- They link signal reception with cellular responses 
2. Why do cells use signal transduction pathways?
	- To modify and regulate its behavior
3. How does a signal transduction pathway begin?
	- With reception of the signal ligand
4. What is the role of protein modification in signal transduction pathways?
	- Creates a shape change that intern calls for a second messenger 
5. What is the role of phosphorylation cascades in signal transduction pathways?
	- They can enhance and amplify signals during transduction.

### [Ap Video 4.3.1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=4i6urljygb&status=assigned) 

1. What role does the environment play in eliciting cellular responses?
	-  The environment characterizes the responses that the cell gives as the cells responses are responses to their environment.
	- Having effective  responses are required for survival
2. How are signal transduction pathways used to influence cellular responses when there are changes in the environment?
	- The signal transduction can change behaviors of the cell in several ways  for example modifying the gene expression to get the desired result
---
- Cells need  to regulate pathways to react  to the environment
- 



### [Ap Video 4.4](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=xcscxu7s4h&status=assigned&type=video)
1. How can mutations in the receptor protein  or any component of the signaling pathway affect the transduction of a signal?
- Because mutations can change the receptor protien effectivly blocking the signal
2. How can chemicals activate a pathway?
-  If we change the protein the effect of the protein can  activate a pathway
3. How can chemicals inhibit a pathway 
- Chemical  -> action that blocks transmition 
---
- Changes in signal transduction pathways can alter cellular response.
- 



###  [Ap Video 4.5](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=v2tft2s9dm&status=assigned&type=video)
1. What are feedback mechanisms?
- A mechanism that reacts to its environment 
- "Balancing act"
2. How does negative feedback maintain homeostasis? 
- By decreasing a negative response to a event through. This means it accounts for an "overshoot"
3. How does positive feedback maintain homeostasis?
-  positive feedback "encourages" positive movement to optimal homeostasis.
---
- Positive feedback amplifies "good" actions. 





### 11/4 Video notes

- Chemical messenger is called the ligand
- signaling begins with the recognition of a ligand
- signals do a bunch of shit in a lot of cells that why there are so many terms
- Signal transduction, signaling pathway and signaling cascade all mean the same thing 
![400](https://i.imgur.com/OJG9Dww.png)
- binding of ligand to ligand gated channels can cause the channel to open or close.
- Phosphorylation or adding phosphate groups changes the shapes of proteins and therefore can effect weather or not a receptor and or receiver are usable
- Second messengers help spread signal  spread
- Signal transduction pathways can effect how the cell responds and this is the big picture of cell signaling 
	- For example signal transduction can change the gene expression of a cell and alter the programed response of that respective cell


**Terms**

1. **Ligand:** A chemical messenger
2. **Second messengers:** molecules that relay and amplify intracellular signals


### 11/7 Video changes in signal transduction pathways  
- Cells comunicate by generating, transmitting, receiving and responding to chemical signals 
- Change in signal molecules can effect the response
- mutations in any domain of the receptor protein or in any component of the signaling pathway may affect the downstream components by altering the subsequent transduction of the signal.
- chemicals can interfere with any component of the signaling pathway
- 

### 11/12 Video: Feedback

1. **Negative feedback**
- maintains homeostatis
- returns system back to its target set point

2. **Positive feedback**
- amplifies
- Variable imitating the response is moved farther away from the setpoint
- Amplification occurs with a positive "outcome" amplifying much of the same

**Terms**

1. **Homeostasis:** The ability to maintain dynamic equilibrium around a set point
