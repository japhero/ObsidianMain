1. what is meant by the flow of genetic information
2. What is transcription
The process by which an enzyme directs the flow of an mRNA molecule 
3. What are the specific mechanisms involved in the transcription process?
Copies are made to transfer the information
1. What are the different types of RNA molecules and what is the function of each?
there are 3 types
1.  mRNA or messenger RNA
	1. carries genetic information
	2. has a codon
2. tRNA or transfer RNA 
	1. Creates a specific polypeptide 
	2. anticodon is  3 base sequence of the T-RNA
3. rRNA or ribosomal RNA
	1. Functional unit of the ribosome 
	2. are responsible for creation of polypeptides

# Topic 6.5.1 Regulation of gene Expression
1. what is gene expression?
- A process by which instructions in the DNA are transcribed and translated into a functional protein.
	- The flow allways goes from DNA to RNA to protein
1. What types of interactions regulate gene expression?
	- Different types of chemical reactions
	- **Regulatory sequences** or streches of DNA that can be used to promote or inhibit protein synthesis 
2. What is epigenetics?
- Revisable modifications or histones/(proteins used to wrap DNA around) these casue the tight packing of the DNA which regulates DNA expression. This happens becasue if you cant acess the DNA you cant express that.
1. How is the phenotype of a cell or organism influenced by differential gene expression?
- Because the gene must be expressed for the phenotype to show and this combination is what ultimately matters when the body expresses a specific phenotype
