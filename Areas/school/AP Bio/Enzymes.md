1. What is the role of enzymes?
	- Biological catalysts that speed up reactions
1. How is enzyme structure related to enzyme function?
	- Most are [[Proteins]]
	- tertiary shape must be maintained for  functionality (binding with the substrate)
	- active site and substrate must match meaning the structure literally the shape of the enzyme matters
1. What determines wether a substrate can interact with an enzyme?
	- Weather the enzyme has an active site that  matches the corresponding substrates
2. What happens to an enzyme after the completion of a reaction?
	*  It gets ready to be reused for the next reaction

1. How do enzymes facilitate chemical reactions in cells?
	- They lower the activation energy  of a chemical reaction allowing it to activate at a more efficient rate and or at a greater speed.
1. What is activation energy in a chemical reaction?
	- The initial starting energy to start a chemical reaction is the activation energy
**Notes:**
-  Enzymes can only facilitate 1 type of  reaction
- synthesis or digestion reactions
