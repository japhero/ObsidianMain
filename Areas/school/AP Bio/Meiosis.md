# DUMP
- meiosis has two complete rounds of nuclear division in S phase
- (Remember: during meiosis, DNA replicates ONCE but divides TWICE, whereas in mitosis, DNA replicates ONCE but divides only ONCE.).
- Haploid cells are only found in the reproductive parts of the body

> Crossover in prophase 1 

- Crossover frequency is the rate at which crossover occurs 
- chiasma is the same as crossover

#### **Terms**
**Haploid cell:** In its most basic definiton a Haploid cell is a cell that contains a single set of chromosomes. 

**Diploid:** Diploid cells as the prefix "di" implies are cells that contain 2 sets of chromosomes.

**Gamete:** Gametes or **sex cells** are reproductive cells containing a set of dissimilar chromosomes, half the genetic material required to form an organism. (making it a haploid cell)

**Allele:** An allele is a variation or mutation of a gene at a particular location.

**somatic cells:** all the cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells

**Chiasma:** the cross shaped structure found at the center of 2 homologous chromosomes performing "cross over".

## AP video 5.1 
1. what is the difference between  diploid and haploid?
	-  Diploid  means there are 2 full sets of chromosomes
		- =2n
		- 4 sex cells
	- Haploid cells contain 1 set of chromosomes
		- =n
2. What is the purpose of meiosis?
	-  To create genetic variation
3. What happens in the series of steps that make up meiosis?
	- very similar things to mitosis
4. What similarities and differences are there between mitosis and meiosis?
	- Mitosis doesn't cross chromosomes
	- Similar in the way genetic information is passed
	- number of resulting cells and genetic  content
---
- 2 rounds of  devision (meiosis I and meiosis II )
- 



## Ap video 5.2
1. What is crossing over, and how does it increase gentic diversity?
	-  Occurs in prophase 1 of miosis 1 
	- Results in recombinant chromosomes
	- is when chromosomes exchange information 
1. When does random assortment of chromosomes in meiosis increase gentic diversity
	- The order during metaphase 1 causes genetic diversity
1. How does fertilization increase genetic diversity?
	- Variation in gametes is what can cause some more genetic variation.
---
- homologous chromosomes contain the same information
