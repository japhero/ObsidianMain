# DUMP
- meiosis has two complete rounds of nuclear division in S phase
- (Remember: during meiosis, DNA replicates ONCE but divides TWICE, whereas in mitosis, DNA replicates ONCE but divides only ONCE.).
- Haploid cells are only found in the reproductive parts of the body

> Crossover in prophase 1 

- Crossover frequency is the rate at which crossover occurs 
- chiasma is the same as crossover

#### **Terms**
**Haploid cell:** In its most basic definiton a Haploid cell is a cell that contains a single set of chromosomes. 

**Diploid:** Diploid cells as the prefix "di" implies are cells that contain 2 sets of chromosomes.

**Gamete:** Gametes or **sex cells** are reproductive cells containing a set of dissimilar chromosomes, half the genetic material required to form an organism. (making it a haploid cell)

**Allele:** An allele is a variation or mutation of a gene at a particular location.

**somatic cells:** all the cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells

**Chiasma:** the cross shaped structure found at the center of 2 homologous chromosomes performing "cross over".
