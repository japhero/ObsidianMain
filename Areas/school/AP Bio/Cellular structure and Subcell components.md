## Lesson 9/17 
- Living things are made up of 1 or more cells
- Cells are the basic unit of life
- All new cells come from old cells
- all cells need energy
- cells pass down hereditary information
- all cells have the same basic structure
	- Cells can vary in a lot of components and only really allways have 4 incomon
**Cell categories**
- Prokaryotic
	- All bacterial
	- Smaller simpler
	- No nucleus, can have a nucliod
	- DNA in a single circular strand
	- No organells except ribosomes.
	- Allways single celled organism
- Eukaryotic
	- Plants animal, fungi, protist
	- Larger than Pro
	- more complex strucutre
	- Nucleus holds DNA
	- many organelles
All cells have 
- Plasma membrane, controlls what comes in and out.
- Cytoplasm, semi-fluid, jelly like substance that holds organells
- DNA, genetic material
- Ribosomes - protein synthesisc (makes [[Proteins]])

**Cell structures**

> [!TODO] Make into "done" section using open stax textbook

- Cell membrane
- Cell wall 
	- Support (not in animal cells)
- nucleus
	- Holds DNA
- nucleolus
- cytoskeleton
- ribosomes
- cilia & flagella
- endoplasmic reticulum
	- Rough or smoth makes lipids and transports protiens and lipids to the Golgi 
- Golgi apparatus
	- Modifies packages sorts lipids and protiens
- Lysosome
	- Digestive enzymes that break down old cell parts (all euk)
	- Breaks down toxic 
- Vacuole
	- Holds nutrients, water, waste (plants have one big, animals have many small)
- Chloroplast
- Mitochondria
	- Cellular resperation (all euk)
- Centrioles 
	- Cell devison (not in plants)
-
