**2 Stages**
- interphase (90%)
- mitosis  (10%)

**Stages of development**
- Prophase
	- "before" stage
	- Chromosomes go from the chromatin form to form a more condensed "sister chromatid". 
	- 2 sister chromatids form a chromosome connected at the centromere
	- Note this is after duplication
- Metaphase 
	- the middle stage in which the chromonseons line up in the middle of the cell 
- Anaphase  
	- Chromosomes move away using spindles which attach to the centriole
	- They move away from the cell.
- Telophase
	- Chromosomes on complete opposite ends and the new nuclei are forming around them.
- Cytokinesis 
	- Responsible for the final seperation between cells. 
	- Completes after the PMAT stages
