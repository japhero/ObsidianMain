> Note I didnt take notes on the example 
- What is a mutation
	- Changes in the genome of an organism
- What are the various gene mutations
	- **Gene mutations** are changes in the nucleotide sequences of a particular gene 
	- 
- What effect do mutations have on nucleic acids or proteins and phenotypes
	- Mutations can result in a change in phenotype 
	- Mutations can also obviously literally change the makeup of the DNA/nucleic acid
---
- Colective function of genes = function of organism
- [[Eukaryotic Gene Transcription]] cycle = Gene -> mRNA -> protein
- can have  varying effect, based  on the  effect on the nucleic acid or protein 
- Disruptions can result in new phenotypes 
- Mutations give genetic variation  
- changes can be considered neutral if it creates the same protein positive if the change creates a protein that benifits the cell and negative if that protein harms the cell.

## [Video 6.7.2](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/home?apd=n968vtis73)
- How does a DNA mutation occur?
	- Errors in DNA Application 
	- Errors in DNA repair
	- Radiation
	- Chemicals
- How do errors during mitosis  or meiosis result in  changes  in the phenotype of a cell or organism?
	- Chromosmes dont seperate properly during devision 
- What determines whether a mutation is detrimental, beneficial, or neutal?
	- The effect on the organism if positive then positve in neutral then neutral ect...

**Triploidy** having three copies of a particular chromosome

**Polyploidy** having multiple sets of homologous chromosomes 



## Dump

- **Missense mutation**
    
    A mutation that changes a single amino acid in a polypeptide chain 
    
- **Nonsense mutation**
    
    A mutation that creates a premature stop codon, which signals the end of protein synthesis 
    
- **Silent mutation**
    
    A mutation that occurs when a DNA nucleotide alteration doesn't affect the amino acid 
    

- **Frameshift mutation**
    
    A mutation that occurs when the addition or loss of DNA bases changes a gene's reading frame

- **Duplication mutation**
    
    A mutation that can happen due to unequal crossing over, chromosomal duplication, or RNA duplication 
    

- **Inversion mutation**
    
    A mutation that occurs when a section of DNA breaks away from a chromosome and reattaches in reversed order 
    

- **Deletion mutation**
    
    A mutation that occurs when a nucleotide is omitted from the replicated strand 
    

- **Translocation mutation**
    
    A mutation that occurs when a segment of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome
