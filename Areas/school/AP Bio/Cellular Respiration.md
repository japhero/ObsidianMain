1. what processes do all forms of life use to produce ATP?
	- Cellular respiration or fermentation 
1. How do eukaryotes coordinate cellular respiration?
	- A series of coordinated enzyme-catalyzed reactions
1. How is an electrochemical/proton gradient formed during cell respiration?

---

- Cellular respiration and fermentation are used to store energy in macromolecules 
- Both cellular respiration and fermentation release chemical energy from organic molecules
- Oxygen is not used during fermentation 
- Fermentation and anaerobic respiration are not the same process
