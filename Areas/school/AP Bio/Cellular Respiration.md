1. what processes do all forms of life use to produce ATP?
	- Cellular respiration or fermentation 
1. How do eukaryotes coordinate cellular respiration?
	- A series of coordinated enzyme-catalyzed reactions
1. How is an electrochemical/proton gradient formed during cell respiration?
	- Its established by the electron energy from electron transport chains

---

- Cellular respiration and fermentation are used to store energy in macromolecules 
- Both cellular respiration and fermentation release chemical energy from organic molecules
- Oxygen is not used during fermentation 
- Fermentation and anaerobic respiration are not the same process 
- ATP is used by cells to do work

- Cellular respiration involves multiple metabolic pathways 
	- Glycolysis - occurs in all living things 
	- Pyruvate oxidation - occurs in mitochondria 
	- Krebs cycle (citiric acid cycle)
	- Electron transport -- occurs in mitochondria
		- Transfers energy from electrons in a series of coupled reactions (chain)
		- allows for more controlled and efficent transfer of energy

1. What is the function of the electron transport chain?
	- It transfers energy from electrons
2. What is the role of $NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$
	- They are electron carriers 
3. How does the electrochemical/proton gradient power ATP synthase?
	- It establishes a electrochemical gradient as a result of electron transfer which intern allow protons to fuel the ATP synthase enzyme reaction
1. What is oxidative phosphorylation?
	- The process of making ATP using the stored energy of a proton gradient.
1. What is the importance of decoupling during respiration?
	- It creates extra heat energy that can be used to regulate temperature.

- Electron transport chain reactions occur in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and in the plasma membranes of some cells.
	- Conserved process
	- in eukaryotes E-chains are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and internal membrane of the chloroplasts
		- Membrane must be present to form a gradient.
	- 
- when $NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$ lose high level energy electrons this is called oxidation
- ATP Synthase adds an inorganic phosphate to ADP resulting in ATP creation
	- (How ATP is formed from ADP)
- Protons  moving along the gradient (diffusion) through ATP synthase, powers ATP synthase.

- In cell respiration, decoupling oxidative phosphorylation from electron transport generates heat.
	- (Moving across the gradient and creating ATP creates heat?)
	- Decoupling means we are using ATP synthase not to create ATP decoupling it from the process.
	- This heat can be used to regulate body temperatures
