An imperial world system should exhibit the following features:  
- The empire should encompass large and bounded area, and be centralized  
- The empire should be economically self-contained  
- The empire should contain core, periphery and semi-periphery polities  
- There should be a net economic flow of raw materials and wealth from periphery to core
- Ethnicity should be used in the division of labor
