- the German economy is an institutional high wage economy specializing in diversified quality production
	- The German model is not feasible long term because of 
		- High unemployment because the economy requires high specialization
- A Weberian ideal type is a conceptual tool created by sociologist Max Weber that is not an average or a perfect ideal, but a one-sided, exaggerated model of a social phenomenon to be used as a benchmark for comparison



**Characteristics of the Nordic Model** 

- A relatively **‘decommodified’ wage relation** — that is, income and means of subsistence, independent of market forces, are guaranteed to a significant extent.
- A **high degree of public commitment to employment-promoting policies**, flanked by implicit incomes policies and structural policies, characterised by corporatist interest intermediation. Similarly to the German model, the objective of these inter-related policy fields was to render social citizenship entitlements compatible with economic stability and international economic competitiveness. 
- **Welfare state universalism**, with services and entitlements provided at ‘normal standard’. In this regard, and in sharp contrast to the German model and other Christian Democratic welfare regimes, as well as the British dualism between minimum universal public standards and private alternatives for the rich, the Nordic model also counters social stratification.
- A **large social service sector**, which also provides the basis for high rates of ‘post-industrial’ employment. This also marks a contrast with the German model.
- As one of the central and combined effects of these definitional features, the constitution of a relatively **‘women-friendly’ welfare state**, which through its combination of opportunities and supports gives women a social role that is independent of their status as wives and mothers.
- Underlying these institutional arrangements and outcomes, a particular class compromise, initially between capital, labour and agrarian interests, and later the white collar salaried strata, where the social democratic labour movement has exercised national– popular leadership. These institutions and outcomes tend to reproduce the conditions of this class accord


- Talks about advocating different ways for analyzing the "models" given one of these being the "grounded model"
- "the Swedish model has in particular served a mythological function for the Social Democratic left, and sometimes the left more broadly, as a particularly progressive form of welfare capitalism, and as providing guidance for a more progressive adaptation of  ‘post-Fordist’ production technology, and even for an economically feasible transformation to democratic socialism."



## Can it Survive 
- Denmark suffered from the "crisis of the welfare state" in the early 1990's.


**Argument against the Nordic model**
- Nordic employment policies and benefit levels designed to produce decommodified social citizenship entitlements generate dysfunctional outcomes on the labour market. This, in turn, generates misallocations and stagnation of output and productivity growth

- Difference between german model and nordic model is that the nordic model expanded into the service sector to make up for the problems that high specialization causes.
