- What is the **world systems theory**
	- "this complementary and interlocking structure of labor delivered to the states and privileged classes of the core the chief benefits of capital accumulation in the world-system as a whole. The latter, by these processes, is eventually divided into core, semi-periphery, and periphery"
	- “the modern global system has an evolving hierarchy based on institutionalized exploitation.”

**Chapter 2**
- Definition for world economy 
	- "large geographic zone within which there is a division of labor and hence Signiant internal exchange of basic or essential goods as well as flows of capital and labor" pg 23
- "we are in a capitalist system only when the system gives priority to the *endless* accumulation of capital" pg 24
	- This means people collect capital for the pourpace of getting more capital endlessly 
- "A market is both a concrete local structure in which individuals or firms sell and buy goods, and a virtual institution across space where the same kind of exchange occurs. How large and widespread any virtual market is depends on the realistic alternatives that sellers and buyers have at a given time." pg 25
- World system is explained on page 28
- "What we mean by core-periphery is the degree of profitability of the production processes." pg 28
- =="Core-like processes tend to group themselves in a few states and to constitute the bulk of the production activity in such states. Peripheral processes tend to be scattered among a large number of states and to constitute the bulk of the production activity in these states. Thus, for shorthand purposes we can talk of core states and peripheral states, so long as we remember that we are really talking of a relationship between production processes." pg 28==
- "what is a core-like process today will become a peripheral process tomorrow." pg 28
- We can expand the idea of core and perioferary to our analysis by seeing that semiconductor production is a core process becasue it is centralized in a small number of companies speciifcally intel, AMD, NVIDIA although others exist the high high end of the technology is done in these companies.
