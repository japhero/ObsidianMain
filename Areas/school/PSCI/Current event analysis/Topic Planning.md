# US China trade war and semiconductor politics 


### **Title** 
- Silicone Hegemony: US China rivalry and the restructuring of the international semiconductor industry.


### **Thesis** 
- This essay argues that the United States has positioned itself as the primary counterweight to China’s expanding dominance in advanced, high-precision manufacturing, particularly semiconductors. The U.S. seeks to weaken China’s economic prospects by reshaping the global economic system to consolidate its own technological advantage. This transformation reflects a broader shift within global capitalism, one largely reactive to changing U.S. economic realities. These realities include American dependence on its tech sector, the growth driven by the AI boom, and national security concerns about limiting China’s military technological development.




### **Core ideas/Guiding Question** 
- The content in the essay should reflect a question this question is: 
	- “Why has U.S. foreign economic policy shifted from neoliberal globalization to strategic protectionism in the semiconductor industry?”

- The United states is shifting away from the liberal world economic order using techno-neomercantilist policy's to protect itself economically from Chinas expanding dominance
	- This idea connects very well to Fredrich lists model of mercantilism were he advised states to use protectionist policies to grow their own internal industries to strength and then export. this can be contrasted because the US is doing almost the inverse limiting a strong economic powerhouse internally to prevent competition from taking away that advantage


- The United states protectionist policy is trying to maintain the current world system by changing the economic world system. Specifically its protectionist policies are trying to maintain Chinas status within the world system as a place for cheap "low level" manufacturing. 
	- This connects to Wallerstein's world systems theory because we can link US intentions to its want to maintain its position.

- The US's attempt at shifting global economic realities is one that is relatively unique as new, as the attempt at consolidation is one only really seen in the high tech manufacturing and military technology industry. 
	-  This offers a counter to trying to establish the topic as one completley reflective of previous trends and ideas. 

- The US's economic plans are a good way to talk about capitalism and its pushes and pulls specifically how isolating China from the US technology export market is a good way to talk about how local market pulls such as the wish for NVIDIA to sell its GPU's to China is controlled by the state to look towards more long term gains.


 - Section "Protectionism or neoliberalism"
	 - talk about how the transition has defined a new economic model for the US specifically a model where the US does strategic isolation






# second Section planning 

The US's attempt at shifting global economic realities is one that is relatively unique as new, as the attempt at consolidation is one only really seen in the high tech manufacturing and military technology industry. 
- This offers a counter to trying to establish the topic as one completley reflective of previous trends and ideas.
