The base of a function $f(x)$ is the x position graph over point y while $f^\prime(x)$ is a function of the slope of $f(x)$ . 


## Step by step

### Finding the inflection points 
because the first derivative is a function of the slope we can use the change in that function to get the inflection points as they will be zeros of the graph as a change in a functions slope will create a zero on its derivative.

in this case the function of the slope $f(x)=x^2$ has a derivative of $2x$ the zeros of that function are zero this means that there is an inflection point at zero this is then proven by the original graph as we can see a local min at the point zero



## Creating a table.
To find the meaning of the inflection points using the first derivative we create a table that holds a sort of number-line a list of values. The table is a table containing weather the intervals between the different points on the graph of the derivative are increasing and decreasing the change in those points such as changing from increasing to decreasing indicates properties of that graph.
