The base of a function $f(x)$ is the x position graph over point y while $f^\prime(x)$ is a function of the slope of $f(x)$ . 


## Step by step

### Finding the inflection points 
because the first derivative is a function of the slope we can use the change in that function to get the inflection points as they will be zeros of the graph as a change in a functions slope will create a zero on its derivative.

in this case the function of the slope $f(x)=x^2$ has a derivative of $2x$ the zeros of that function are zero this means that there is an inflection point at zero this is then proven by the original graph as we can see a local min at the point zero



## Creating a table.
To find the meaning of the inflection points using the first derivative we create a table that holds a sort of number-line a list of intervals in between inflection points. The table will typically be created as values in between those intervals  are passed into the function and weather they are positive are negative is decided
