# Examples 

## Example 1 

$2x^{-2} - 8x^{-5}$

We are trying to factor out the **GCF** (**G**reatest **C**ommon **F**actor)
 
1. When factoring with negatives factor out the lowest number so $2x^{-5}$ 

2. To find out what's the result we have to divide each piece by the **GCF**. 
	1. First we will find the **GCF** which is $2x^{-2}$. 
	2. Then divide by that **GCF** individually starting with  $2x^{-5}$
	3. We then actually create the division:  $\frac{2x^{-2}}{2x^{-5}}$



3. Next we solve for the division to get the result 
	1. Negate the 2 by dividing it out: $\frac{x^{-2}}{x^{-5}}$
	2. Flip the exponents to get rid of the negative: $\frac{x^{5}}{x^{2}}$
	3. Then the result is $x^{5-2}=x^3$

4. We then do this again with $8x^{-5}$ to get $4$.

5. Finally we put all of out results together to get.
$$2x^{-2}[x^3+4]$$
