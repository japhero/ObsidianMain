### What do you observe as significant
- Depicts Gatsby's house as the center of the world
- More Gatsby mystery talk "Hindenburg's" 
- Seems like nick is a regular at Gatsby's house now
- all people on the list seem old money
- Nick views Gatsby as the "man who hosts the parties"
- Gatsby
	- Was educated at oxford but didn't like it?
	- His familys from the middle west san Francisco
	- All of his family died and he got lots of money 
	- He then lavishly and **<u>materialistically</u>** did expensive and fancy things.
- Nick finds the stereotype of Gatsby's story very funny. He maby thinks that gatsby is vain in thinking hes the "main character".
- The war is a "great relief" i think because he had found purpose and distracted from his suffering which is also implied not to be the death of his family?
- The story that Gatsby tells is truly as nick describe comically stereotypical the fall of a character and then the rise again through the millitary and fighting the Germans. Maby this is a comment on the other book he wrote that was a basic literature.  
- He carry's his least significant war medal, Maby a testament to how Gatsby isn't absorbed in materialism for himself  even through his lavish spending
- Nick is "astonished" that the medals are real but also again describes Gatsby's facial expressions very eloquently.
- Gatsby's reason for "drifting" is trying to forget the sad thing that happened to him.
- Gatsby wants to go with nick to get tea with miss baker his motivation is unclear.
- Gatsby going past the vally of ash and then getting away from the police maby emphasizes the previlage that gatsby has.
- Southeastern Europe reference is to the war.
- Nick maby racist's or maby he views the white limousine interaction as unusual/absurd which it probably was.  
- Wolfsheim
	- German name translated to "wolfs village/home."
	- Flat nose = Antiemetic?
	- Who does gatsby need to pay to "shut his mouth"
	- Gloomy crude unlikeable person.
	- Gambler
- Gatsby leaves tom immediately maybe he doesn't like him because of his interest in Daisy.
- Toms clingy towards nick
- Ms baker gives her into to how she met daisy and how daisy was always a higher social class than her again "trophy wife". She also sneak dis Tom by saying daisy was playing around with flat footed men that couldn't even make it in the army.
- Tom allways showed his "affection" through materialism and no real emotion along with the fact that daisy didnt want to marry him on their wedding night.
- Every "happy" story of tom and daisy has horrible messaging behind the chamber maid, daisy drunk
- The song is reference that I get but doubt mine is the originally as i know it from a  song by louis prima called Medley. (listening to it when i wrote the notes funny enough)
- Gatsby is obsessed with daisy enough to place his house across from her.
- How does jordan know all of this? just inference?
- Nick obviously seems in love with Jordan. 
- Nick and Jordan seem like bonny and Clyde in this situation making calculations to help Gatsby win over Jordan because she "deserves something in her life " Fair play.
