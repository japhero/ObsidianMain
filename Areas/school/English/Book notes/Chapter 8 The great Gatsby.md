### What do you question in this chapter? 
- Unscrupulously?
- Why was Daisy so special to Gatsby, the only reason given was that she was the "first nice girl”
- Why was Tom the answer to Daisy's search because of his status?
---

### What do you observe as significant
- "I felt i had to warn him” Nick is foreshadowing Gatsby's untimely end  
- Gatsby is feeling nostalgic and hopeful 
- Gatsby continues to “ramble” about his past, probably in pursuit of making it in the future. He could also be trying to relive the past.
- Daisy's life seems easy and is described so, having every luxury and always being the center of attention. Although, one might understand the social pressure that she has undergone, especially as her family probably deems it her “duty” to get married and follow their lifestyle.
- "Wholesome bulkiness" is a literal and figurative way to describe Tom.
- Gatsby's expectation that daisy should have never loved tom is an unrealistic expectation, and minimizing tom and daisy's love comes off as insecurity.
