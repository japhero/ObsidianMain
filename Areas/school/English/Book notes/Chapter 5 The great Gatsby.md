### What do you question in this chapter? 
- I also think that the author wants to play with the clich√© here with Gatsby and daisy's relationship.

---

### What do you observe as significant
- Gatsby tries to befriend Nick enticing him with a car ride.
- Gatsby is very causal about the invitation to tea with daisy even though we know that he cares a lot about the event.
- Gatsby offers nick work to make more money but he refuses Gatsby prefaces it with the fact that its supposed to be confidential this represents the shady side of him the side associated with the mob **Wolfsheim**. Even Nick acknowledges this 
- Finn is mentioned for the first time assumed to be his roommate.
- Gatsby seems very nervous saying he wants to leave tea early and worrying.
- I believe that whenever nick uses bold and colorful language that he is describing someone he likes a lot he does this with daisy describing how the sound of her voice reverberated across his ears.
- "Gatsby pale as death" pg(86)
- Daisy doesn't seem very enthusiastic very "matter of fact" and Gatsby seems obsessed remembering dates and times up to five years in the past. 
- Nick is being a hype man/wingman for a very nervous Gatsby encouraging him and also kind of pusing him off a clif by leaving which is assumed to mean that hes trying to leave daisy and him alone.
- His statement about being serfs vs peasants is ironic considering peasants are of a higher class than serfs.
- Daisy was in  tears when nick reentered and Gatsby was bright saying "old sport".
- Although her tears seem of joy and she used Gatsby's first name.
- Everything Gatsby has seems to be to make him seem sophisticated. 
- Daisy seems now instantly enthralled with him immediately putting her arm through his.
- "Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever" Pg(93) $\leftarrow$ seems very heart warming but worries me because the book isn't over. 
- "his count of enchanted  items had diminished by one." the magical mystical aspects of daisy are no more to Gatsby because she is now a reality to him no longer a mystery.
- Daisy doesn't seem taken aback by his apparent obsession.
- I have a prediction that Gatsby's Business is the only thing that can make him the villains in the eyes of Daisy.  (his fishy phone call)
- Gatsby using the Music to advance with daisy, all the things they are doing seems like they are making up for lost time.
- "There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams---not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her beyond everything. " pg(95) $\leftarrow$ very very important in the context of the story a story about dissolution Gatsby is a representation of the inverse a man who has deluded himself into a reality so heavily that that seems to be at the core of his character.
