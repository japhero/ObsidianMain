# General notes
- The narrator is in a hospital but is hallucinating maby a reference to religious aspects to reference somone giving him medicine but the text is very confusing.
- Overall theme of music is displayed but unclear message/plot device.
- How is him not having lots of room necessary for the treatment. 
- They plan to use him as a test dummy for a lobotomy.
- the doc trying to diagnose is turned into asking existential questions.
	- He also asks basic questions, questions that he would ask a child and it sooths the narrator from more existential questions such as who are you, whats your, name and what's your mothers name
- Maby we dont know the narrators name because he literaly forgot it in this section of his life or mabye its a symbol of his defunct identity.
- Through the introspection he recognizes some of his flaws
- The perspective of the narrator currently is confusing.
	- Because if this is recolection of his past he obviously currently doesnt know it therefore at some point he must regain it and that is left open for question.
- the company also is trying him to sign away his rights under the guise of fair compensation. Considering he had just gotten what was askin to a lobotomy this is obviously trying to take advantage of him.
- the  woman calls out people like him as the ones to make changes.
- but she also helps him after is fall
- Even under the womens advice he belives that he doesnt want to follow that path.
- The narrator seems to regain his clarity in mind dissgussting nuance in "his" own peoples aproach to progress.
- the narrator poors somthing on somone he thinks is bledso but is not and gets banned for life/99 years
- narrator is afraid of the whitewashing of his culture 
- Narrator sees opression of older couple, maby this is a shift in the book to a perspective closer to **Marcus Garvy** as the generally more negative things that the narrator is shown especially about race relations.
- Narrator becomes an orator again and gives speach in response to the couple
- what warrents the narrator to become a speaker again although the innit is obvious it is a little bit random.
- why does jack make a character anylisis so fast and says the "he was watching a death"
