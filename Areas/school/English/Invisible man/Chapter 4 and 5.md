## Chapter 4
The General idea of chapter 4 was that the main character was deathly afraid of how Dr. Blodese would treat him as a result of his adventure with Mr. Norton. The interaction is strange as the Dr is described as using somewhat off a facade when interacting with white poeple and is for example described as not eating with white guests and so forth. In my opinion this was the major theme of the chapter fear, fear of the white man from the docter or fear from the Dr as in the main character and then by proxy the white man. This fear orriginates form the idea from the founder that the black man must act in a way almost subservient to the white man as the Dr acts and expects his students to act again because of fear.

- Fear
- The Dr
- Mr norton

## Chapter 5
i Would say that chapter 5's major theme is religion throught the entire chapter there are several references made to religious events and  the chapter takes place in large part in a chapple with a reverend giving a speach about the story of the founder. This chapter uses the rellgious aspect to convey its message that black people should go follow the way of the founder
