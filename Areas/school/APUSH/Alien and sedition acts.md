Imbued with political strength in congress after the conflict with the french the federalist party began to consider ways in which to silence the Republican opposition. The result was one of the most controversial acts in American history the [[Alien and sedition acts]].

The sedition act allowed the government to prosecute anyone who was committing "sedition" against the government. This was left loosely in definition to allow the government to stifle opposition.
