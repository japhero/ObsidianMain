# Feedback on original thesis 
You seem to be setting up a two-body-paragraph essay which is problematic. Focus is usually lost with this framework. (-1) Your thesis talks about "values" and not the construction of the Constitution. (-2) Solid document analysis. Your final thesis offers up "personal beliefs" as a category. I don't know where you would go with this. It's too vague. (-2)   **-"Mr. Mace"**
