==Astronomers call that the “cosmic microwave background.” It’s the residual radiation of the Big Bang, the explosion that created the universe fourteen billion years ago.==

This line really stood out to me because it was a really effective way to contrast the modern way of thinking (scientific analysis) and more mythological concepts. 



==The message is this:  
You be good. I love you.==

This final line also struck me as it is a very effective way to recall the line from the parrot Alex and make the reader really consider what the parrot is saying as in puts this weird voice of a bird into perspective it is like the bird alex. 


==My species probably won’t be here for much longer; it’s likely that we’ll die before our time and join the Great Silence. But before we go, we are sending a message to humanity. We just hope the telescope at Arecibo will enable them to hear it.==

I note this line because it confuses me. I expected this poem to break voice and to create a concrete message about human existence but it rather continues on this slightly comical voicing of a bird im just not sure what the overall reason was of this.



## Summary 

The Great Silence is written from the voice of a parrot who sends a letter to humanity with a message about the fact that the human like intelligence humans have been looking for in the universe has been here on earth all along in the form of a parrots. This parrot "x" goes on to tell humans about its species condition and the explains why humans should have realized that parrots are intelligent and taken respect to that intelligence.  


## Response 

I disagree with the bird i don't think it makes sense for humanity to stifle out pursuit of other extraterrestrial life in service of paying more attention to nature. These concepts aren't mutually exclusive. The entire premise for the critique is that what we are looking for isnt in the stars but rather right in front of us and that the things we should pursue and pay attention to are the things on earth. The problem with this is that this just plain and simply is not true, there are things to explore beyond just this earth the Fermi Paradox is real and isnt going away and in the pursuit of humans survival intelligence and recognition it is our responsibility to continue to push what is possible. This phrasing of human interactions relative to the unknown isnt limited to the literal unknown of space and the piece does have that part right, we should try and learn more about our surroundings we should try and explore the unknown at home and we should try and prevent the great silence in our forests, in our skies and in our seas. Furthermore the framing of Parrots as this intelligent life form that humans have been missing all along doesn't make a strong argument for the fact that there must be something at 'home' for humans to find, I think the piece would have made a better and clearer message if it had simply broken its voice somewhat towards the end and made a direct call to action or had a concrete message based in reality and not in science fiction.
