## Requirements 
- The final essay must be 8-10 pages, double-spaced, in an appropriate citation format, such as MLA or APA, with one-inch margins and 12 pt. Times New Roman Font.
- A Works Cited page that lists **ALL of the sources in your paper** must be attached to your paper. 
- You are required to cite **four sources** in this essay (these should be scholarly, significant, and non-fiction sources). If you choose to use more sources than this, consider how scholarly and appropriate they are. 
- You are **required** to cite **one fieldwork source**: a survey or an interview(s). We’ll review fieldwork and practice writing questions as we move through this unit. 
- You must cite from EACH of your sources (citing could include a paraphrase, summary, or direct quotation).
- If it would make rhetorical sense to your paper, it is acceptable to include a visual. Appropriate examples would be a photograph, diagram, or drawing. For instance, for your fieldwork, you may wish to put your survey results into a bar graph. Note that if you do use a graphic, only use one that makes sense to your topic, and do not include them to simply “take up room” in your paper. If you take a visual from another source, you must, of course, cite it.
