#English 


Write a revision reflection that’s at least 400 words. Prompts you might answer include, but are not limited to:

- What function is your introduction serving? Can you create more intrigue in your opener?
- Do your paragraphs have enough examples, quotes, paraphrasing, and summary from other sources to provide support for the main sub-argument of each paragraph?
- Do you have a counterargument represented? If someone with opposing views was reading your paper, how would they counter your claims and how would they substantiate their arguments? Be specific. What effect would including that counterargument have in your paper?
    - Sometimes, a counterargument that you can then counter will support your argument.
    - Sometimes, simply acknowledging a counterargument – or even pointing out the ways it’s effective or valid – can actually _strengthen_ your argument. Why might this be?
- Are you forcing certainty on an argument or sub-argument which, realistically, is more nuanced? Or where the existing evidence points to more uncertainty than your paper is currently admitting? Be specific.
- What function is your conclusion serving?
- Are your MLA citations correct? How about the punctuation? Do you include the page number in the in-text citations for any sources with page numbers?
- Do you attribute all thoughts that aren’t original?
- Can you cut, trim, combine ideas where you’re being redundant?
- Review your research/Brooke Notes to see if you have any more apt citations, any sources you would like to revisit, etc.
- Ask yourself, "What's my best _____ and my weakest _____?" (sentence, example, paragraph, transition, reference quote, source, etc.)
- Do your thesis and the arguments presented in your paper match? Do you have room to go back and make your thesis more specific, exact, and tailored, now that you’ve written your whole paper and seen your argument come to life?
- After reading your paper, what outstanding questions do you have for yourself? What hard questions does your paper avoid? How can you challenge your thinking to new heights?
- Do your sources actively support your thinking or just fill space? If you’re going to quote directly from the text, it means that the author has said something so well that paraphrasing it will devalue it, or there’s a passage you’d like to unpack for the reader. Quotations should be a part of your chain of reasoning, like everything else. If they feel separated or detached, reconsider why you’re using them. Is anything gained by including the whole quotation instead of just select phrases? Find an instance where you question your use of a citation.


# Reflection 


I think the biggest issue for me was the fact that it was my first time writing an analytical argumentative paper of such length for the the first time. More specifically it was really hard for me to approach certain sections such as Methodology and be able to really understand what something like that should look like. With the example of methodology specifically i understood the goal of the section, write out how you conducted your research, but i was more stuck on the specifics how do you introduce such a section should i write my reasonings for certain survey choices for instance into the section or should it only be about exactly how my survey and interview where performed. Specifics like these made sections like methodology and the Introduction more difficult as i wasn't fully aware of what the standard practice for them was. In retrospect its now much easier to analyze the wholistic integration of such sections and how they fit in. 

The biggest mistake i made was not starting with the IMRAD format when starting as when i fully integrated that format the cohesiveness and structure of my paper became clearer and i understood what i needed to do to make my paper better. An example of this would be how i can better tie my research into my discussion, i better understood this after writing my results section as one peice rather than writing out statistics or quotes form either my interview or survey within the discussion. 

I think i do a really good job in incorporating sources and making them have a "conversation" i think within the sourcing i could maybe include the page number to more specific quotes although most of the sources given where a academic paper with a relatively short length. The few quotes that were taken were mostly taken out of abstracts anyways.  

The main critique i would have is that i wish the discussion section would more directly reference figures within the results section as it does reference data and observations found in the results section but it doesnt directly reference figures. I probably could have refactored some of the points to use figures from the results section.  Additionally im very happy with the figures that i was able to create as they didnt simply reference one question but rather they referenced the relationship between different answers. For example talking about how people who rated their high school performance a 10 answered other questions opens up details about the difference in respondents. When referencing the thesis i think the arguments made where sound and that they reflected the thesis well additionally i think i addressed counterarguments consistently and adequately.
