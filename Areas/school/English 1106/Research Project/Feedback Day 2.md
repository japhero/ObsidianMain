## Presentation 1 (sports science/tech improvements)
The presentation uses good examples and grounded itself well within the point that the presenter is making. More specifically I think the examples backed the points made very well. I think the images were a little rugged and maybe the slides could have had more actual content on them although the images that were selected were very effective. 

## Presentation 2 (AI in finance)
I really like how the somewhat complicated ideas within AI in finance were broken down into simple concepts as after all it is a children's book. Also summarizing the actual paper at the end was helpful to get the final point. 

## Research paper 1 (Phone usage effects)
The actual paper looks very professional and the graphics were helpful in understanding the point of the paper. The points of the paper were also explained very well and the presenter did a good job going over the poster and connecting some of the data within it to the overall idea.


## Research paper 2 (Balance academics & Extracurriculars)
The graphics in the paper were very well done and just the general aesthetic of the paper was very good. I also think the speaker did a good job becasue they managed to get through a lot of the specifics of their paper (how they sourced both primary and secondary) and how they impacted their conclusion. Also reflecting over the assignment was helpfull and gave the whole thing more focus.
