**Thesis**
So, political ideology, religious affiliation, and government policy all serve to negatively harm LGBTQ+ students’ social experience on campus in Virginia Tech.

The thesis is very specific and gets manages to underline direct policies very well establishing a clear "so what" concerning the reasoning of the paper and the overall impact that the papers information will have on the reader. 

The methods section is a nice inclusion but if given the chance i dont find in necessary to list every question within the survey rather the section on the impact of the survey would work. Within this section you could also elaborate on why you picked to do a survey and a interview. 


I like the fact that the discussion opens by talking about TPUSA and the points within that section are well written especially the direct quotes that give a lot of weight to what kirk says. Although within this section it would be nice to have a little more elaboration on why the statements make LGBTQ+ people uncomfortable. It may seem self evident that his statements are offensive to that community but i think because you are arguing that you cant rely on that implication and the argument would be stronger given an explicit description of the harms that kirks word create. further on that transition into more general types of discrimination works very well and logically flows well. 

The sectioning is done well and i like the way that the essay is separated into distinct ideas.
