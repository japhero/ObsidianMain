The introduction of the research proposal has many strengths, for one it does a really good job of bringing in your own personal memories to strengthen and contextualize not only the reason for your choice of topic but also goes to establish an interesting idea/argument that does well to give the reader an expectation for the rest of the proposal and then the actual paper. Although there are some changes which could strengthen this part. The very first sentence is bland and just repeats something which is already implied by the header giving something immediate for the reader to grasp their imagination to would improve introduction.  

The research questions are also done well, both interact with the topic in a fascinating way and both bring out something from the topic that is separate and unique from the other question but still interesting. More specifically talking about how societal perspectives change in one question and then talking about how those same societies build induvial opinion is an contrast which gets both a macro and micro level at the whole picture. 

The sourcing is also done well including both anecdotes and research papers, although i would be more specific on what sources are used for what research question. What source is used to answer what question and how.

The introduction is well done it starts out with a clear description of what  your topic is and does go into some detail, it then does a good job in the second paragraph of establishing some background what makes this project interesting, why is it important etc. More specifically i think the structure is well done as foremost the questions/broad introduction is divided by a paragraph as the second section is more about personal reasons and importance. This second paragraph is divided up well each little section going into rapid detail about not only how this study could help reflect students experiences but how policymakers could use this paper to reflect on actual student outcomes. 

The research question could use more work as when reading it it comes off as a description of survey questions not the ideas that will broadly be explored by the results of the survey making these questions more specific would help not only make the reader understand what you want to explore in this project but what you are trying to answer. 

The Resources and research method section does a good job of establishing exactly what you will be doing but honestly does this a little to much. Being specific about what will be put into questionaries is relevant to the paper but is a procedural description which doesnt give the reader a good overview of what those questions are there to achieve.  Although more of how these questions are used is mentioned it seems like this section doesnt elaborate enough to give a clear idea.
