#### Water analogy
 - Current is flow rate 
 - Voltage is the pressure difference between the two pipes

#### DC vs AC
- Current constant with time is direct current **(DC)**
- Current that varies with time reversing direction periodically is alternating current **(AC)**
	- This can have several waveforms not only $\sin$



#### Voltage
- Voltage is the energy transfer per unit of charge $(\text{Joules/Coulomb})$ 
	- This would mean across a 12V circuit 12J are transferred for every coulomb moving across it. 
- Positive to negative transfer is considered delivery wears negative to positive is considered supply. 


#### Energy
- can be a function of time 
$$
w=\int_{t_{1}}^{t^2} p(t)\, dt 
$$
- Negative power means energy is supplied 


#### Kirchhoff's Current Law
- "The net current entering a node is zero"
	- Solving methods in [[9_3_2025 ECE]]


#### Nodes
- the point in which two or more circuit elements are connected together.
	- In shorter words its the a point where several parts of a circuit connect 
	- "All points in a circuit that are connected directly by conductors can be considered to be a single node"

#### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
"The algebraic sum of the voltages equals zero for any closed path" 
- the same current will allways flow through the same "loop"


### Circuit Elements
- Constant sources of voltage are denoted with a circle
- A Dependent voltage source or a voltage source that is a function of other sources is denoted with a Dimond


- **Independent current sources**
	- An ideal ICS forces a specified current to flow through itself the symbol being a circle enclosing an arrow that references the direction of the current

- Independent Current Sources 
	- The independent current source forces a specified current to flow through itself. The symbol being a circle enclosing an arrow that gives the reference direction. 
	- Later on we can see that a good real equivalent to a current source is a electronic amplifier but a traditional example like a battery for voltage doesn't exist.
