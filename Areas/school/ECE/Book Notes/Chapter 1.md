 **Water analogy**
 - Current is flow rate 
 - Voltage is the pressure difference between the two pipes

**DC vs AC**
- Current constant with time is direct current **(DC)**
- Current that varies with time reversing direction periodically is alternating current **(AC)**
	- This can have several waveforms not only $\sin$



**Voltage**
- Voltage is the energy transfer per unit of charge $(\text{Joules/Coulomb})$ 
	- This would mean across a 12V circuit 12J are transferred for every coulomb moving across it. 
- Positive to negative transfer is considered delivery wears negative to positive is considered supply.
