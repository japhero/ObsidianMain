 2.1 Covers boolean algebra and the basics of hardware diagrams described in ECE 1004 



## HDL Representation of Gates

Two main HDL languages are 
- VHDL 
- Verilog 

- In reality HDL languages describe the same circuits as the ones drawn with diagrams but they make it simpler to describe larger more complex circuits that are impractical to do by hand. This method of describing circuits is called **<u>structural description</u>** 
- Such a structural description is called a ***<u>netlist</u>*** 

**Syntax example for primitive representation**

## 2.2 Boolean Algebra
Generally this just describes the different operations that can be completed and described in a mathematic esq format

- A **<u>multiple-output Boolean function</u>** is a mapping from each of the possible combinations of values 0 and 1 on the function variables to combinations of 0 and 1 on the function outputs. 
- A **<u>single-output Boolean</u>** function is a mapping from each of the possible combinations of values 0 and 1 on the function variables to value 0 or 1
- A **<u>truth table</u>** for a function is a list of all combinations of 1s and 0s that can be assigned to the binary variables and a list that shows the value of the function for each binary combination.
