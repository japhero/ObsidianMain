## Encoding 
- Encoding is when you represent "items" or information with a given code
	- The class example was color where 8 primary colors are represented in binary with 3 bits. 


**Decimal codes**


**Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)**
- Each digit is represented as a 4 bit binary number 
	- 1: 0001


The last 4 digits of my hokie pasport are 5252 which is `0101 0010 0101 0010` in BCD


**Weighted Code**
- Any weighted code where the weight is multiplied by the value in the representation.   
	- In a 4 digit binary this means if given a 1 in the specified slot you multiply that by the "weight". The weights for binary are `8 4 2 1` so given `0010` you do $1\times 2=2$ and you have 2 as your value.



**Excess codes**
- Where a offset value is added to each traditional binary value for a digit to create a new representation
	- So if i wanted to represent 1 in an excess 3 code i simply add the binary representation for 3 to the binary representation for 1
	- `0011` + `0001` = `0100`



**Gray Codes**
- In gray code one and only one code is changed in between successive values.  
- A potential issue with the original implementation of gray codes was that 10% of gray code changes (going from 0->9) would change 3 bits at the same time 


**ASCII code**
- 7 bit code
- No invalid codes

**Single bit parity**
[[Areas/school/ECE/Book Notes/Logic & Computer Design Fundamentals Fifth Edition/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]] talks about this 



## Combinational Logic gates


**Common Gates**
- AND
	- Only 1 if all are 1
- OR 
	- Returns 1 if any inputs are 1
- NOT
	- One input and output simply returns the inverse 

- these functions are functionally complete meaning any logic expression can be expressed with 

**Complementary Gates**
- NAND 
	- Not AND
- NOR
	- Not OR
- XOR
	- Odd number of 1s returns 1 even number returns zero 
	-  1 0 = 1
	-  1 1 = 0


- Complementary gates NAND and NOR have less transistors and are more efficient in pure transistor count 




## Logic Values and Voltages 
- Logic systems deal in 1's and 0's but in reality these values are represented by voltage usually 5 3.3 or 2.5



**CMOS**
- stands for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor 
- Complementary comes form the fact that there are both n type and p type transistors

-  Ideally transistors are closed controlled switches that are either open or closed 








## ANKI CARDS
- Ones complement 
- twos complement
