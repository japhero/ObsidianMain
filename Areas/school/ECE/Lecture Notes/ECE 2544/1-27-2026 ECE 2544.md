**NMOS** and **PMOS** transistors
- PMOS transistors are used to connect to logic 1 or 5v and close switched for logic 0
- NMOS are connected to ground and are closed for a logic 1 

**CMOS Logic**
- If the switch is ON the switch is closed and if its OFF its open switch 
- We always want our 5v to either go to the $V_{out}$ or ground we never want it to float.
- Network of transistors that connects to ground is called the pull down network and the network of transistors thats connected to 5v is called a pull up network

**In general**
- NMOS transistors provide pathways from logic 0 to the output 
- PMOS transistors provide pathways from logic 1 to the output
- Transistors in series represent AND branches
- Transistors in parallel represent or branches
- The pathways are duals of each other (if one is a series connection, then the other is a parallel connection)
- No static path exists between $V_{DD}$ and ground 

## Structural Verilog 
- Verilog has different levels of abstraction 
	- Gates 
	- Boolean Expressions
- You can have instances of lower level circuits within your higher level circuit this means you can build large circuits out of smaller circuits that you have already created. 
	- When you instantiate circuits within Verilog unlike in software it copies the instance to the place were it is needed it doesn't reference the place in memory were your previous circuit was defined. This is because Verilog represents physical circuits and cant reference previous circuits in memory.

### Verilog Syntax Notes
- The circuits name is called a type name and is defined with `module`
- You label your symbols these are called instance names 
	- these are practially called type names 
		- not, or, and ... etc 
- You label wires in between different symbols (eg "w1")
- There are keywords to label inputs and outputs 
- every instance name must be unique
- Semicolons end every line except for `endmodule`
- A Bus is representative for a vector which means that there are several values within indexed like a list eg
	- `decleration [MSB:LSB] name;`
		- lets say we have 4 bits and i want to get the 4th bit i would do `vector_name[3];`
	- Example `input [3:0] bus1;`
- For built-in instances the parameters are defined with the output first and then the input. 

### Submodule Instantiation
- Work just like instantiating basic symbols at its foundation obviously you can have varying effects but fundamentally we are simply connecting different different inputs and outputs which represent transistor layouts.

### Timing Diagrams 
- The propagation delay is the amount of time that it takes for the input to reach the output within the gate. 
- The critical path is the path in which it takes the longest for the electrical signal to go from input to output  
	- We use the critical path to find the propagation delay
