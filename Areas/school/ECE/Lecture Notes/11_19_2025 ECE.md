# Lecture Notes
- We can give an opp amp negative feedback by putting the $V_{out}$ back into the negative input of the opp amp 
- Negative feedback loops allow a system to be stable despite fluctuations


### Op AMps

- The two opp amp rules 
	- No current flows through the input terminals 
	- The two input voltages are equal (when there is negative feedback)
		- This only applies to opp amps and not to comparators 
	-
