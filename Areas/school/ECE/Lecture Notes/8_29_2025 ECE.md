# Lecture Notes
- Electrical current is the time rate of flow (think “derivative”) of electrical charge through a conductor or circuit element.  
- Charge has the units of Coulomb, and it comes  from the fact electrons have charge.  
- The units are amperes (A), which are equivalent to Coulombs per second (C/s).


- current = rate of change 
$$
i(t) =\frac{dq(t)}{dt}
$$
$$
q(t)=\int_{t_{0}}^t i(t) \, dt +q(t_{0}) 
$$
- constant current of 1 A means that 1 C (coulomb) of charge passes through the conductor each second. 

#### Energy Transfer
- Energy is transferred when charge flows through an element having a voltage across it.
- Resistors don't supply energy they only absorb it. 
- We label current directions using a subscript where the leftmost symbol is the origin. These can be inverted by making the sign negative. 
$$
i_{ab} =-i_{ba}
$$
> This equations means charge going from point $a$ to $b$

- This notation also indicates the sign of the point meaning the leftmost point with a positive sign is the positive position and the rightmost is negative. So for the example above $i_{ab}$, the point $a$ is positive and the point $b$ is negative. 
#### voltages
- The voltage associated with a circuit element is the
energy transferred per unit of charge that flows through
the element. 
- Volts is equivalent of joules per coulomb 
- Joules per second is a watt 



#### Passive sign convention
- Current flows from high potential voltage to a lower potential voltage. This means from $+$ to $-$ this is the opposite of the electron flow. 

- Current that flows from positive to negative is deemed positive, wear as current that flows form negative to positive is deemed negative. 


#### Ohms Law 
$$
V=I*R
$$

#### Resistors
- They can manipulate the resistance of the circuit which in turn can change our current and voltage values because of [[#Ohms Law]].
- power is dissipated as heat in a resistor 

## Definitions

#### Voltage 
- Voltage is the electrical potential energy between 2 points in a circuit

#### Current 
- the amount of current is dependent on the difference in voltage 
- Current flows from high voltage to low voltage 
- measured in amps 
- physical analogy is how much flow  

#### Resistance 
- How a circuit impedes current flow 
- A physical analogy is how a pipe is narrowed to decrease the amount of water going through the pipe. 


#### Power
- the rate of energy transfer from one potential to another 
- Power will be proportional to the amount of difference in potential (voltage) and the amount of flow (current)
- Power is a positive quantity when energy is absorbed and is a negative quanitity when energy is supplied by a source.
