# Lecture Notes
- Power loads are greater $\cong 1 \text{Watt}$
- In high power a high R Thevenin is desired to improve efficiency
- For signal level applications, the key factor is instead maximum power transfer. 


**Source transformations**
- You can replace a voltage source by shorting and rewriting this with a current source.

**Norton Equivalent**
- The Norton equivalent is simply the Thevenin equivalent with a source transformation.
- Norton resistance is exactly the same as Thevenin resistance 
- Norton current is the same as the short circuit current
