- Thevenin resistance really represents internal resistance of the source sometimes also called the output impedance


- Superposition 
	- Remove voltage sources and then solve for the changes based on each individual voltage source.
	- Directionality matters so when we combine the "voltage contributions" of each source we make sure to take the direction of the current into the account.
