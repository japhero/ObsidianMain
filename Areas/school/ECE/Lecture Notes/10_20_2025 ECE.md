# DUMP
- Convert to twos compliment 
	- Flip all bits
	- then add 1
- Left most bit still becomes signed bit 


- subtracting in binary
	- Same idea as in decimal 
	- subtract the "subtrahend" where the subtrahend is the number that is being subtracted ($3$within $5-3$)
	- To make it easier for the computer 
	- If you carry a bit that is larger than our BYTE remove it 

- Twos compliment works because what it does is represent negative numbers in a way where if we add them to positive numbers we end up doing a subtraction operation

**Example Create -27 as a bit representation using twos compliment**
$$
 \begin{array}{lll}
27 \to & 11011 \\
8\text{ bit} & 0001\,1011 \\
\text{flip}  & 1110 \,0100 \\
\text{Add 1} & 1110\,0101
\end{array}
$$
- We can check negative numbers using twos compliment because the process will always simply change the sign so flipping it back will always give a positive which is much simpler to check. 



## Logic Gates


- **Combinational logic**
	- Their output is determined on the immediate input at the moment they are observed
- Logic gates are created using transistors

**Gates**
![|center|400](https://www.nutsvolts.com/uploads/articles/NV_0501_Byers_Large.jpg)
- **Not**
	- Just as in code it simply switches the signal input 
- **AND**
	- Has AB inputs 
	- Both AB need to be high for the output to be high


- Within gates **X** means exclusive. so for example **XOR** means exclusive **OR** gate which is simply the **OR** gate in which only one input can be positive. The other exclusive gate is the **XNOR** in which both inputs must be the same to get a positive output
