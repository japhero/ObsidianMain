## First Lecture Notes 
- "Power" has traditionally come from heat.
- Power triangle $p=vi$ (ohms law)
- Total energy is $$E =\int_{0}^t p(t)\, dt =v \times i \times t = \text{joules}= \text{watts}-\text{sec}$$
- power is joules/second also known as watts
	- So for example 1 watt would also be 1 joule per second
- Effiency is $\frac{\text{energy output}}{\text{energy input}}$
