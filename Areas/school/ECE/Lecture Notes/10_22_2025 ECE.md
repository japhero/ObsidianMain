- De'morgans law are two laws that relate to conversions between AND clauses and OR clauses 


$$
\begin{array}{ll}
AB= \overline{\bar{A}+\bar{B}} \\
A+B = \overline{\bar{A} \bar{B}}
\end{array}
$$
> This can be expanded to three variables

- We can implement any logic function using only AND gates and inverters
- Applying De Morgan's Law to diagrams is called bubble pushing 



**Turning Truth Table Into logic expression**

1. (SOP)
	- Look for rows where there is a 1 in the output 
	- The **minterm** is a product of all the inputs 
	- The total logic equation is the sum of the products
2. (POS)
	- Could also focus on rows where there is 0 in the output (maxterm)
	- Write a sum for each row where $D =0$
	- The maxterm is a sum of all the inputs 
	- The total logic equation is the product of sums 

for example if there is a truth table row such as 

| A   | B   | C   | D   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
Where $D$ is the output 

one of our operators would be 
$$
A+ \bar{B} + \bar{C} 
$$
which would become an input for D

- SOP is generally prefered becasue it uses NAND logic which is better for manufacturing '
