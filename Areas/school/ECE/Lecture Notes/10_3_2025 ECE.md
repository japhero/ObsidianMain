- Basics of capacitors
	- Provide clean voltage
	- Provide pulses of power
	- Used to make DC voltage from AC voltage 
	- Used to pass signals in amplifiers 
	- They are used as filters to reduce noise


- In this class we talk about 
	- Blocking DC 
	- Storing energy 
	- Suppressing noise  

- Some capacitors are "polarized" meaning one end has a negative and positive terminals
- Stripe indicates negative terminal on aluminum 
- The noise that wires create can be removed by "shorting" that noise to ground
- One Farad is $1 \text{ coulomb/Volt}$
- Capacitance is determined by the geometry of the capacitor
	- proportional to the area of the plates A
	- Inversely proportional to the distance between them 
$$
C=\frac{\varepsilon A}{d}=\frac{q}{V}
$$
> $\varepsilon$ is the permittivity


- Capacitors in parallel behave like resistors in series 
$$
C_{eq}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}\dots +C_{n}
$$
- Capacitors in series behave like resistors in parallel
$$
C_{eq}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\frac{1}{C_{3}}\dots+\frac{1}{C_{n}}}
$$

$$
{
\begin{array}{l} 
C=\frac{q}{V} \\ \displaystyle
V=\frac{q}{C} \\ \displaystyle
q(t)=\int_{t_{0}}^t i(t)  \, dt +q(t_{0}) \\ \displaystyle
 i(t)=C \frac{dV(t)}{dt} \\ \displaystyle
V(t)=\frac{q(t)}{C}=\frac{1}{C}\int_{t_{0}}^t i(t)  \, dt + V(t_{0}) 
\end{array}}
$$

- current through a capacitor must be zero when the voltage is the same. 


**IRL Types of capacitors**
- Coupling capacitors: 
	- block DC and pass AC used in series
- Decoupling Caps:
	- Reduce noise used inn parallel with larger ones 
	- Often called "bypass" capacitors 
	- These caps act like low pass filters 


- When we see DC conditions we assume capacitors are open circuit because they are no longer drawing current 
- If we have a charged capacitor we treat it like an open circuit meaning <u>there is no current across it</u>.

## Questions
- Why do decoupling capacitors block **DC** voltage and pass AC voltage?
