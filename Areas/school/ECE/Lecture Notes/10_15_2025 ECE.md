- To get the byte for a specific number take  $\text{floor}\left( \frac{x}{2} \right)$ where the remainder is the bit for example 

$$
\underbrace{
\begin{array}{l|l} 
\frac{343}{2} & 1 \\
\frac{171}{2} & 1 \\
\frac{85}{2} & 1 \\
\frac{42}{2} & 0 \\
\frac{21}{2} & 1 \\
\frac{10}{2} & 0 \\
\frac{5}{2} & 1 \\
\frac{2}{2} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{2} & 0
\end{array}}_{
\text{Fraction | Remainder}
}
$$
> Stop when the quotient becomes 0 but also remember that our byte is stored in <u>**opposite order of computation**</u>


- To go from binary to base 10 each bit tells us weather or not to multiply by $2^n$ where $n$ is the number of bits in reverse order

**Example**

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\boxed{001010111} \\
0(2^9)+0(2^8)+1(2^7)+0(2^6) +1(2^5) +0(2^4) +1(2^4) +1(2^3) +1(2^2) +1(2) \\
\large =343
\end{array}

- Converting a number from binary to hexadecimal involves grouping the bits
into sets of four, and then converting each group into a hexadecimal digit.
(octal is groups of three)
- Converting a number from hexadecimal to binary involves expanding each  
hexadecimal digit into a group of four bits. (octal is groups of three)
- Converting a number from hexadecimal to decimal can involves summing  
the powers of 16 that correspond to the hex values.  
-  Converting a number from decimal to hexadecimal can involves performing  
integer division by 16 and fraction multiplication by 16.



- When we convert using decimal we use the exact same procedure as when converting by binary except we divide by the Base number
$$
\begin{array}{l|l}  
x \\
\frac{x}{b} &  \text{mod}(x,b)  \\
\frac{x}{b^2} & \text{mod}\left( \frac{x}{b}, b \right) \\
\vdots   & \vdots \\ 
\frac{x}{b^n} & \text{mod}\left( \frac{x}{b^{(n-1)}},b \right)
\end{array}

$$


**Adding Binary**

$$
\begin{array}{rrr} 
  110   \\  
+  111 \\
\hline   1101
\end{array}
$$
> when we have $1+1$ within binary we get $10$ where the 1 carries a 0


**Signed Bit**
- MSB
	- the leftmost bit indicates the sign a 1 is a negative number
