## Mesh 
- Mesh is the opposite of nodal
- Uses KVL to solve for currents 
- Solving
	- We solve for every loop in a circuit 
	- Each "mesh" cannot contain more than one "loop"
	- All loops must be in the same direction 
	- Like nodal we write a system of equations using KVL and then solve 

**Example linear Equation**
$$R_{1}(i_{1}-i_{2})$$
> where $i_{1}$ is the current going from across the resistor in a arbitrary direction and $i_{2}$ is the current going in the opposite direction from $i_{1}$ 


### **Example Mesh**

Creating the mesh equation for $i_{1}$ would give
$$
R_{2}(i_{1}-i_{3})+ R_{3}(i_{1}-i_{2})-V_{a}=0
$$
> notice that across resistors we are writing a ohms law $(V=IR)$ equation for voltage hence KVL. Also notice that our current for each resistor is simply the current loop - any loop going the the opposite direction.

- When we have two unknow mesh's across a current source we create a "supermesh" 
	- The mesh going into the current source will have a negative sign 
- A lone current source will simply give us the current in that loop although the sign can change based on direction 
- 


### **Example Supermesh**

> Across the current source we can relate $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ using $i_{2}-i_{1}=5$. Then we treat the entire bottom half as one mesh but across each individual resistor we would still use $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ 

**Supermesh Source equation**
 $$
i_{2}-i_{1}=5
$$

**Supermesh equation**
$$
i_{1}(1\Omega) + (i_{1}-i_{3})(2 \Omega)+ (i_{2}-i_{3})(4\Omega)+10V=0

$$
