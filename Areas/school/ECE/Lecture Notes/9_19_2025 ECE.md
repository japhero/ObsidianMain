## Mesh 
- Mesh is the opposite of nodal
- Uses KVL to solve for currents 
- Solving
	- We solve for every loop in a circuit 
	- Each "mesh" cannot contain more than one "loop"
	- All loops must be in the same direction 
	- Like nodal we write a system of equations using KVL and then solve 

**Example linear Equation**
$$R_{1}(i_{1}-i_{2})$$
> where $i_{1}$ is the current going from across the resistor in a arbitrary direction and $i_{2}$ is the current going in the opposite direction from $i_{1}$ 


### **Example Mesh**

Creating the mesh equation for $i_{1}$ would give
$$
R_{2}(i_{1}-i_{3})+ R_{3}(i_{1}-i_{2})-V_{a}=0
$$
> notice that across resistors we are writing a ohms law $(V=IR)$ equation for voltage hence KVL. Also notice that our current for each resistor is simply the current loop - any loop going the the opposite direction.

$$
\color{white} \text{loop}_i \text{ equation} = I_{1}R_{1} + I_{2}R_{2}+ \dots I_{i}R_{i} \space\pm V_{\text{source total}} 
$$

$$
\begin{array}{ll} 
\text{loop}_{1} \text{ equation} = (i_{1}-i_{3})R_{2}+(i_{1}-i_{2})(R_{3})-V_{a} \\
\text{loop}_{2} \text{ equation} = V_{b} + i_{2}(R_{4}) + (i_{2}-i_{1})R_{3} \\
\text{loop}_{3} \text{ equation} = (i_{3})R_{1}-V_{b}+(i_{3}-I_{1})(R_{2}) 
\end{array}
 
$$


- When we have two unknow mesh's across a current source we create a "supermesh" 
	- The mesh going into the current source will have a negative sign 
- A lone current source will simply give us the current in that loop although the sign can change based on direction 
- 

$$
\begin{array}{c}
i_{1}-i_{2}=1 \\
\boxed{i_{1}=1+i_{2}} \\
 \\
-21V+i_{1}(6\Omega)+i_{2}(4\Omega)-5V =0 \\
-21+(1+i_{2})(6)+4i_{2}-5=0 \\
10i_{2}=21-6+5 \\
\boxed{i_{2}=2} \\
 \\
i_{1}-2=1 \\
\boxed{i_{1}=3}
\end{array}
$$



### **Example Supermesh**
![[Pasted image 20250919103643.png|center|400]] 
> Across the current source we can relate $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ using $i_{2}-i_{1}=5$. Then we treat the entire bottom half as one mesh but across each individual resistor we would still use $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ 

**Supermesh Source equation**
 $$
i_{2}-i_{1}=5
$$

**Supermesh equation**
$$
i_{1}(1\Omega) + (i_{1}-i_{3})(2 \Omega)+ (i_{2}-i_{3})(4\Omega)+10V=0

$$
