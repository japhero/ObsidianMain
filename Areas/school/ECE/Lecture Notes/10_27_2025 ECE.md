**Current in a capacitor** 
$$
i(t) = C \frac{dV(t)}{dt}
$$
**Energy In a Capacitor** 
$$
w=\frac{1}{2}Cv^2
$$
**Power In a Capacitor**
$$
p(t)=i(t)v(t)
$$
**Charge in a Capacitor**
$$
V=\frac{q}{C}
$$



- ideal capacitors have these characteristics 

- tantalum, OSCON, aluminum capacitors are polarized



- Power supply caps
	- ripple capacitors 
	- large electrolytics
- Coupling caps
	- block DC and pass AC used in series
- Decoupling 
	- reduce noise used in parallel with larger ones 

- Capacitors add up in parallel 
$$
C_{eq} = C_{1} +C_{2}\dots C_{n}
$$
- Capacitors in series 
$$
C_{eq}^{-1} = \frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}\dots+\frac{1}{C_{n}}
$$


- Curved side on a capacitor in a diagram is the negative side

- Energy stored in a capacitor
$$
w=\frac{1}{2}Cv^2
$$
- Under DC conditions capacitors act like a open circuit 



### Inductors

$$
B= \text{magnetic flux density}
$$

- Changing flux results in changing current 

$$
v_{l} =L\frac{di}{dt}
$$
> where $L$ is the inductance and measured in Henries

- One henry is 1 volt-second ampere

 $$
p=vi=\left( L\frac{di}{dt} \right)
$$
- Under DC conditions an inductor acts like a short 

- Calculate $L_{eq}$ like you would resistors


### Circuits 


- Capacitor is open circuit under DC conditions 
- Inductors are a short under DC conditions 



### Combinational Logic 


- Product of sums 
	- invert all logic variables that are 1 
	- Target all rows that equal 0
- sum of products
	- Terms that equal 1
	- In the truth table look for the ones with a $1$ in the output 
	- 1 is a minterm 
	- Each value with a 0 is inverted and then written as a sum with all values for that row 


| A   | B   | C   | D   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |



### DIODEs

sum of products is preferred because NAND gates use less transistors 

p-type is doped with boron for an excess of holes
N-Type is typically doped with phosphorous for an excess of electrons


- Current flows from **p** to **n** 
- Voltage drop across a diodes gate is 0.7V
- LED voltage will have a voltage drop of 2

- PWM is pulse width modulation

## De'morgans Law 

- Two Laws that relate to conversions between AND and OR clauses 
$$
\begin{array}{\ll} 
AB= \overline {\bar{A}+\bar{B}} \\
A+B= \overline{\bar{A}\bar{B}}
\end{array}
$$

**Steps**

1. Replace all variables with their inverses
2. Replace ANDs with ORs and vice versa 
3. Finally invert the entire operation




## HW 7 Application Notes

- Within boolean expressions they dont work like binary math for example 
	- A+B is A OR B 
	- AB is A AND B
