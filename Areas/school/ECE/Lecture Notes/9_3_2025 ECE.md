-  Voltage "Drop" in a resistor along with its associated current determine the amount of power dissipated as heat by the resistor. 
	- further we can combine several laws to get eqations for power relative to current and resistance for example
	- $P=I^2*R$
	- $P=\frac{V^2}{R}$
- Theoretical wire resistance is zero but in reality its just a very small number 
$$
R= \frac{\rho \cdot L}{A}
$$
>$\rho$ is resistivity (ohm-meter)
>$A$ is cross sectional area of wire  


- In a conventional car headlight circuit the headlights are practically resistors considering that they take energy from the circuit and produce light and heat. 

$$
\text{Conductance} =\frac{1}{\text{resistance}}
$$
- **Siemens$(\mho)$** is the unit for conductance and is $\frac{1}{R}$

- We should use the same voltage for all elements in parallel 
- Elements in series have the same current 


**Kirchhoff’s Current Law**
- Elements A, B, C, and D can be considered to be connected to a common node, because all points in a circuit that are connected directly by conductors are electrically equivalent to a single point
- The algebraic sum of all currents at any node is zero
- Nodes are just where different parts of a circuit connect without something in between
- The current coming in must be **equal** to the current going out 

**Kirchhoff's Voltage Law**
- Algebraic sum of all voltages is equal to zero 
- One method to solve for current is to take the know voltage drop and then add our known resistance times our unknown current and then solve for current. We know this works because $V=IR$, we know $R$ and we also know $V_{1}+V_{2}\dots +V_{k}=0$. So we can create 
$$
V_{\text{battery}} +IR_{1}+IR_{2}=0
$$



- If given circuit with 2 resistors 1 5ohm, 1 3ohm and a 5v battery we have the equation
$$
0=5+2i+3i
$$
> giving $i=-1$
