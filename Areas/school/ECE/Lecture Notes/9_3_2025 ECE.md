-  Voltage "Drop" in a resistor along with its associated current determine the amount of power dissipated as heat by the resistor. 
	- further we can combine several laws to get eqations for power relative to current and resistance for example
	- $P=I^2*R$
	- $P=\frac{V^2}{R}$
- Theoretical wire resistance is zero but in reality its just a very small number 
$$
R= \frac{\rho \cdot L}{A}
$$
>$\rho$ is resistivity (ohm-meter)
>$A$ is cross sectional area of wire  


- In a conventional car headlight circuit the headlights are practically resistors considering that they take energy from the circuit and produce light and heat. 

$$
\text{Conductance} =\frac{1}{\text{resistance}}
$$
- **Siemens$(\mho)$** is the unit for conductance and is $\frac{1}{R}$

- We should use the same voltage for all elements in parallel 
- Elements in series have the same current 


**Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law**
- Elements A, B, C, and D can be considered to be connected to a common node, because all points in a circuit that are connected directly by conductors are electrically equivalent to a single point
- The algebraic sum of all currents at any node is zero
- Nodes are just where different parts of a circuit connect without something in between
- The current coming in must be **equal** the current coming out 

**Kirchhoff's **

# TODO
- Read chapter 1 
- HW due Monday 
- Study resistor color codes
