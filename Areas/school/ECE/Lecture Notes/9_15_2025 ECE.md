### nodal analysis 
- Write out equations for every node 
- The assumption is that all currents are leaving the mode, and leaving is now positive. 
-  We solve for voltages by doing a systems of equations 
- Nodal uses **<u>current</u>** so we must make sure that each term in our KCL equation is current. 
- EXAMPLE for $v_{1}$:
$$
\frac{v_{1}-v_{2}}{R_{2}}-i_{1}=0
$$
 > this assumes that $R_{2}$ is the resistor between $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$. It also assumes that the current $i_{1}$ is entering the node. 
 
- This equation works because we are using **<u>KCL</u>**, so remember just using KCL we would get
$$\large {
(i_{out_{1}} +i_{out_{2}}\dots+i_{out_{x}}) - (i_{in_{1}} +i_{in_{2}}\dots i_{in_{x}}) = 0}
$$
- But now using a version of ohms law $I=\frac{V}{R}$
$$\large{\frac{
v_{1}- v_{2}}{R_{2}}\dots+ \frac{v_{1}-v_{x}}{R_{x}}+i_{\text{total I leaving}}=0}
$$

## Super Nodes 
- if we have a resistor between a voltage source and ground we treat surface across the voltage source as one node.
- We can also write equations to represent the relative differences between the two nodes on either end of the voltage source 
	- For example if my nodes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are on either end of a voltage source the positive end facing $n_{1}$ then i know that the voltage at $n_{2}=n_{1}+V_{s}$. where $V_{s}$ is the source voltage.  
- The way we write this [[#nodal analysis]] but we use variables because either node on either end of the super node are included. Then we write out the relationship between the two nodes and substitute
