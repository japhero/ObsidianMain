- When solving circuits we can combine resistors to get a resistor that is the same value as the combination
	- Start farthest away from the source
- The purpose of getting the resistor is to find the current


- Voltage sources in series must have the same voltage 


### Voltage Divider 
- Voltage divider is created within a **2 resistor network** by manipulating Kirchhoff's law  
$$
v_{1}=v_{i} \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}
$$

- When finding a voltage across a node use the resistor that is connected to ground. 


### Current Divider 
$$ 
I_{r{2}}=I_{s}\left( \frac{R_{a}}{R_{a}+R_{b}} \right)
$$
