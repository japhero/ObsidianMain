- Any complex system can be reduced to 3 components

- The point of Thevenin's theorem is to see how the source circuit responds to a change in loading. 
- Any network with two open terminals can be replaced by a single voltage source $V_{t}$ and a series resistor $R_{t}$ connected to open terminals. 


- Procedure
	- Find the open circuit voltage called the Thevenin voltage 
	- Find the short circuit current 
	- Thevenin resistance $= \frac{\text{open circuit voltage}}{\text{short circuit current}}$
