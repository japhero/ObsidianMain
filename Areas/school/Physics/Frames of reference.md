# Definition:
A frame of reference is a set of coordinates that can be used to determine positions and velocities of objects in that frame; different frames of reference move relative to one another. **Mine:** A space/description of an object relative to some position or velocity. 

## Things to note 
- The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames (this is known asÂ **Galilean invariance**)
	- Put in another way, there is no experiment that you could do to determine which reference frame you are in
	- This means that we can address problems in any reference frame to give an equivalent solution.

# Math 
We can transform from one frame to another by adding or subtracting their relative velocity, depending on the relative direction of the relative motion. Therefore to make our frame relative to a certain velocity we must subtract all other velocities by the original to make it relative

To make it relative to frame $U_A$ we just subtract $U_A$ from all [[Vectors|Vectors]] meaning:
$U_A = 5m/s, U_B = 3m/s$ 
$U_A - U_A = 0$
$U_B-U_A = -2$
