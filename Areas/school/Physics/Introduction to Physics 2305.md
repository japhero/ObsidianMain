- When emailing note class
- [x] Setup i clicker 
- communicates through canvas
- read the book
- the lectures are just a broad outline of course material the book is what gives finer detail 
- Reading quizs weakly the lowest 4 are dropped 
- Iclicker quiz is done in almost every lecture the lowest 6 are dropped
- HW due 12pm every friday 25% per day late
- Pre quiz's are extra credit (CANNOT NEGATIVLY IMPACT GRADE)
	- can earn up to 1/2 of missed points on exam

# Material 

#### **Motion diagrams**
- Motion diagrams: We overlay freeze frames of an objects motion with the same interval of time between each object
- One motion diagram model is the point model where the object is modeled by a point that moves left to right

#### Position & time
- uses a parametric system of reference (time is the variable )
- Has a arbitrary origin (t=0, (0m,0m) )
- $\vec{r}$ is the position vector


#### Vectors vs. Scalars
- $\vec{r}$ is the generic position vector

- Scalars
	- described by a value 
	- can be +,-,0
	- example mass, time, speed
- Vectors
	- Described by a value with units while also specifying direction
	- magnitude: length of a vector 0,+
	- Examples position $(\vec{s})$, displacement $(\Delta \vec{s}),$ velocity $(\vec{v}_{s})$
- **Displacement**
	- change in position: $\Delta \vec{r}$
	- starting position = $\vec{r_{i}} \to$ new position $\vec{r_{f}}:\vec{r_{f}}=\vec{r_{i}}+ \Delta \vec{r}$
	- **distance** is a scalar, length of the path traveled

## Definitions 
- mechanics: science/study of motion 
- kinematics: mathematical description of motion 
- motion: change of an objects position w/time
- Trajectory: is the path that an object follows 
	- **Translational motion**: is the motion of one place to another
