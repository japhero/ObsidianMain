## Types of  reflection
- Two types of reflection 
	- Specular reflection
		- When angle of reflectoin is equal to angle of incedence
	- Diffused reflection
		- A uneven surface will scatter light rays into unpredictable directions 

- Incident ray is the ray that hits and reflects a surface
- Reflected ray is the ray that is reflected 
- Angle of incedence is equal to the angle of reflection $\theta_l=\theta_{r}$

##  [Refraction and Snell's law](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
- Refraction is when the light goes through an object

- when light slows down the ray refracts to its relative right, when it speeds up it goes to its relative left. (by relative i mean facing the direction it is going.)


### Snell's Law
$$
\frac{v_{2}}{\sin \theta_{2}}=\frac{v_{1}}{\sin \theta_{1}}
$$
Index of refraction  $\large{n}=\frac{\text{speed of light}}{\text{velocity of that light}}=\frac{c}{v}$

therefore we can rewrite snells law as (this is how it is written in formula sheet)
$$
n_{1}\sin(\theta_{1})=n_{2}\sin(\theta_{2})
$$
