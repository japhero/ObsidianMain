- units of electric potential $v$ is joules per coulomb $j/c$
-  We can use the defintion of voltage to calculate the real potential energy $U_{e}$ because  $V=j/c$ 
- $j$, joules is any type of energy
- $U_{e}=V\cdot q$
- $V=K\frac{Q}{r}$
- Voltage refers to a difference in electric potential

**What's the difference between $emf$ and voltage $v$, considering they both measure potential energy?**

- $\text{emf}$ is electromotive force and is considered the "ideal" voltage of a source. this is because it is $\text{emf}$ that acts as the "supply" to the battery 
- Voltage is the actual measured difference between 2 points
