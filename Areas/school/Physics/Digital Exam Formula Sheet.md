# Kinematics

## Constant Acceleration 
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v_{fs}=v_{is}+a_{s}\Delta t \\
s_{f}=s_{i} +v_{is} \Delta t +\frac{1}{2}a_{s}(\Delta t)^2 \\
v_{fs}^2=v_{is}^2+2a_{s}\Delta s
\end{array}
$$
> $s$ indicates an arbitrary direction $(x,y)$


## Uniform Motion Kinematic Equations
	
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v_{s} = \Delta s/ \Delta t \\
s_{f} = s_{i} +v_{s} \Delta t
\end{array}
$$

## Uniform Circular Motion
**Angular Velocity**
$$
\omega =\frac{2\pi r}{T} = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$
> Where $T$ is the **Period** and $r$ is the **radius** of the path of motion
****
**Centripetal Acceleration**
$$
 \vec{a}=\frac{v^2}{r}
$$
> where $v$ is the velocity tangential to the motion of a particle at a specific point.
****

**Magnitude of Centripetal Acceleration**
$$
a=\omega^2 r
$$
> where $a$ is the magnitude of Centripetal Acceleration
****
**Tangential Velocity**
$$
v = \omega r
$$
****


**Definitions**
1. **Period:** The period is the amount of time it takes for the particle to do 1 revolution. 
2. $\omega$ (omega): is the symbol for angular velocity were positive $\omega$ is counter clockwise
3. $\alpha$ (alpha): is the symbol for angular acceleration were positive $\alpha$ is counter clockwise

# Friction 


## Static Friction
**Force of static Friction**
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
F_{s}\leq \mu_{s}F_{n}  \\
F_{s}^{\text{MAX}}=\mu_{s}F_{n} 
\end{array}
$$
> where $\mu_{k}$ is the coefficient of static friction


## Kinetic Friction
**Force of Kinetic Friction**
$$
F_{k} = \mu_{k} F_{n}
$$
> where $\mu_{k}$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction

# Springs 

**Energy Stored in a spring**
$$
U_{s}=\frac{1}{2}k(\Delta s)^2
$$
> Where $\Delta s$ is the distance between the spring equilibrium and its "stretched position"

**Hooke's Law**
$$
F=-k \Delta x
$$
> $k$ is in the opposite direction because the spring pulls against the forces that displace it. $\Delta x$ is the displacement from the springs equilibrium.  

****

**Spring constant for springs in parallel**
$$
k_{eq}= k_{1}+k_{2}\dots +k_{n}
$$
**Spring constant for springs in series**
$$
k_{eq}^{-1}=k_{1}^{-1}+k_{2}^{-1}\dots +k_{n} ^{-1}
$$

# Newtons Laws of Motion 

## First
An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with the same velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.

## Second 
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
$$
F=ma
$$

## Third

![||Right|200](https://stickmanphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Newtons-3rd-wall.jpg)

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.Â  When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the first object.

$F_{1}=F_{2}$

# Gravity

$$
g=\frac{F_{\text{M on m}}}{m} = \frac{GM}{r^2}
$$

# Energy

**Definition of Work**
$$
\Delta E_{\text{sys}}=W_{ext}
$$
> where $W_{\text{ext}}$ is the amount of energy leaving
****

**Kinetic Energy**
$$
K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

****

**Gravitational Potential Energy**

$$
U_{g}=mgh
$$
> where $h$ is the hight from an arbitrary position


****
**Work for non constant force**
$$
W=\int_{s_{i}}^{s_{f}} F_{s} \, ds 
$$
> work done by for $\vec{F}$ as a particle is displaced from $s_{i}$ to $s_{f}$ 
>$F_{s}$ is the component of $\vec{F}$ in the $s$ direction 

****

**Work Done with constant force**
$$
\begin{array}{l}
W=F(\Delta r)\cos \theta \\
W= \vec{F} \cdot \Delta  \vec{r}
\end{array}
$$
> (work is done by a constant force) where $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the particles displacement $\Delta  \vec{r}$ 

****

**Total system work equation**
$$
\Delta E_{\text{sys}} = \Delta K + \Delta E_{th} = W_{ext}
$$
****

**Power Definition**
$$
P = \frac{dE_{sys}}{dt}
$$
****
**Power relative to a constant force and velocity**
$$
P= \vec{F} \cdot  \vec{v} = Fv \cos \theta
$$

# Vector Equations 

$$
\theta= \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{A_{y}}{B_{x}} \right)
$$
> This is useful to find the $\theta$ of any any vector just remember the "functional domain" of $\tan^{-1}$ $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2} \right]$

$$
|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{ a_{x}^2 +b_{y}^2}
$$
> Within $\mathbb R^2$
