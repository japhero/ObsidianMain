## Harmonic Oscillations

- Period is the time in-between peaks of the wave
- Amplitude (unit: $m$) is the peak position of the wave

- Phase constant is an initial offset for the angle of the pendulum
	- Practically it is an offset so that the behavior of the function matches the wished behavior. this is needed because when graphing not all functions will start at the max amplitude like observed when using $\cos$ to model the behavior of the oscillation. 

$$
x = \cos (\omega t + \phi_{o})
$$




**Hertz** 
$$
\frac{1}{\sec} =\text{Hertz}
$$



**Frequency in terms of the spring constant and the mass of the a object on an mass spring model**

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{ \frac{k}{m} }
$$




**Frequency**
$$
f=\frac{1}{T}
$$

**Angular Frequency**
$$
\omega =2\pi f
$$
- in practice this affects formula such as the frequency equation for mass on a spring by removing the $2\pi$ already found on the equation for example 
$$
f = \left( \frac{1}{ \cancel{2\pi}} \sqrt{ \frac{k}{m} } \right) \cdot \cancel{2\pi}
$$

### Simple pendulum's
- Mass is irrelevant

- Can be mathematically described by the relationship 

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{ \frac{g}{l} }
$$
> where $l$ is the length of the string



### Physical Pendulum 
- Given that the pendulum doesn't have its center of the mass at the same position as the furthermost point on the pendulum.

$$
f=\frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{ \frac{mgd}{I} }
$$
> where $d$ is the distance to the center of mass and $I$ is the moment of inertia

The mass is again irrelevant as even though it is in the equation it will cancel once the proper moment of inertia is found.
