## Friction 
Rubbing two objects together can cause one object to lose electrons and another to gain them. The object the loses electrons become positively charged and the other object becomes negatively charged.

## Conduction 
A charged object is touched to a neutral object the neutral object then gains the same charge as the initially charged object.

## Induction 
A charged object is brought near, but doesn't touch, a neutral object. The natural object becomes polarized. This happens because the charge on the rod forces the electrons on the neutral electrons to move away causing a rift and subsequently Polar.
