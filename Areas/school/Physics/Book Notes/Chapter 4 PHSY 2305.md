- General form for a position vector using unit vectors
$$
\vec{r}=x\hat{i}+ y \hat{j}
$$
- Average velocity equation changes within its representation of $\Delta  \vec{r}$ giving 
$$
\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta  \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = 
\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \hat{i} + \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} \hat{j}
$$
> where $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ are unit vectors of the $x$ and $y$ position respectively 

- basic calculus: instant velocity is tangent to position 
$$
\vec{a}_{\text{avg}}=\frac{\Delta  \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
$$
> remember that $\Delta  \vec{v}$ has a direction so is the vector of the sum of all velocity but **directional**


$$
\vec{a}_{\text{avg}} = a_{x} \hat{i}+ a_{y} \hat{j}=  \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}= \frac{dv_{x}}{dt} \hat{i} + \frac{dv_{y}}{dt} \hat{j}
$$
- You can componentize the kinematic equations found for constant acceleration 

### [[Frames of reference|Reference Frames]]
- Is the difference between frames of reference simply the point of its origin 
	- No becasue frames of reference can have velocities. For example if i am moving at 20m/s in one direction the things around me especially if they are moving too will have different "relative" velocity and position.

**Galilean transformation of velocity**
- If you know the velocity of an object in one frame of reference you can transform it into another


### Uniform circular motion 
![[Pasted image 20250907190617.png]]

- A particle moves around an "origin" within the path of a circle with radius **r** 
- The velocity is always tangent to the circle
- The amount of time it takes to go around the circle once is called the **period $(T)$** 
$$
v= \frac{\text{1 circumference}}{\text{1 period}}=\frac{2\pi r}{T}
$$
- angular equations use a polar coordinate system to set the position of the given particle 
- ARCLENGTH FUCK
- $\Delta \theta$ is angular displacement 
- $\omega$ is positive for counter clockwise rotation and negative for clockwise rotation

## Definitions 
- Coordinate systems that move relative to each other are called [[Frames of reference|reference frames]] 
- $\omega$ is the symbol for angular velocity 
- $\alpha$ is the symbol for angular acceleration 
- $v_{x}=\frac{dx}{dt}$
- $v_{y}=\frac{dy}{dt}$
- Conversions to polar 
	- $v_{x}=v\cos(\theta)$
	- $v_{y}=\sin(\theta)$
- $v=\sqrt{ v_{x}^2 +v_{y}^2}$
- $\theta= \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}} \right)$
- $$
\vec{a}_{\text{avg}} = a_{x} \hat{i}+ a_{y} \hat{j}=  \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}= \frac{dv_{x}}{dt} \hat{i} + \frac{dv_{y}}{dt} \hat{j}
$$

- $$
\vec{a}_{\text{avg}}=\frac{\Delta  \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
$$
- $$
\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta  \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = 
\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \hat{i} + \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} \hat{j}
$$
- $$
\vec{r}=x\hat{i}+ y \hat{j}
$$
- **Period $(T)$** the amount of time it takes for a particle to go around its circular motion once. 
- $\Delta \theta$ is angular displacement 
- $$
\Delta \theta =\theta_{f}-\theta_{i}
$$

- $$
\text{average angular velocity} = \frac{\Delta \theta }{\Delta t}
$$
- $$
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$
