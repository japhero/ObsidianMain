- The most important step is to define the system
-  net change in energy is the sum of all of the individual changes 
	- $\text{net change}= \Delta\text{changes}$
	- $\Delta E_{sys}=W_{ext}$
		- Where $W$ represents the work done on the system by the environment.
- The energy of an isolated system doesn't change
- $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
	- Kinetic energy is energy of motion so it depends on the mass and speed but not on its position. 
	- By definition kinetic energy can never be negative 
	- Its unit is $1\text{ kg } \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2$ or a **joule**


- **Work**
	- $\Delta K= k_{f}-k_{i}=W$ 
	- the unit is also **joules**
	- $W=F_{s}\Delta s$
	- In the example where a particle is changing direction in isnt changing its energy becasue its speed isnt changing. 
	- $W_{tot}= \sum_{i=0}^i W_{n}$
	- $E_{sys}=K_{tot}=\sum_{i=0}^i K_{n}$
	- $\Delta K_{tot}=W_{tot}$
	- need to remember the relative meanings for kenetic energy simply kenetic energy of what, the system, a single particle etc
$$
W=\int_{s_{i}}^{s_{f}} F_{s} \, ds 
$$
> work done by for $\vec{F}$ as a particle is displaced from $s_{i}$ to $s_{f}$ 
>$F_{s}$ is the component of $\vec{F}$ in the $s$ direction 

$$
\begin{array}{l}
W=F(\Delta r)\cos \theta \\
W= \vec{F} \cdot \Delta  \vec{r}
\end{array}
$$
> (work is done by a constant force) where $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the particles displacement $\Delta  \vec{r}$ 


$$\vec{A} \cdot  \vec{B}=AB\cos(\alpha)$$
> where $A$ and $B$ 

-  A force acting on a particle does no work unless the particle is displaced


**Variable force**

$$
W=\int_{s_{i}}^{s_{f}} F_{s} \, ds 
$$
**Constant Force** 
$$
W= F( \Delta r)\cos \theta
$$
> where $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the particles displacement $\Delta  \vec{r}$ 



**Thermal Energy**
- One way for objects to release energy while remaining in energetic equilibrium is by releasing thermal energy think dragging a sofa, the sofa doesn't gain any potential or kinetic energy rather the energy used or the work done to move it is released through thermal energy/heat.
$$
\Delta E_{\text{sys}} = \Delta K + \Delta E_{th} = W_{ext}
$$
- When using thermal energy we must use both objects because both objects heat energy changes. 
	- So when using the sofa example above when talking about the energy system we must include both the energy of the sofa and the energy of the floor because boths thermal energy changes.
$$
\Delta E_{\text{thermal}} = f_{k} \Delta s
$$
- Dissipative forces always increase the thermal energy they never decrease it. 
- "The techniques used to calculate the work done on a particle cannot be used to calculate the work done by dissipative forces."



**Power**
$$
1 \text{hoursepower} = 1 \text{hp} = 746 \, W
$$

- The rate at which energy is transferred or transformed is called the power $P$, and is defined as 
$$
P = \frac{dE_{sys}}{dt}
$$
- Unit of power is a **Watt**
	- **$1 \text{watt}=1 \,W=1 \,J/s$**
- if we do some derivative manipulations we can solve power in terms of force and velocity
$$
P= \vec{F} \cdot  \vec{v} = Fv\cos \theta
$$


## Definitions
- System Energy is defined as $E_{sys}$
- $\Delta E_{sys}=W_{ext}$
- $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
	- 
$$
v_{f} = \sqrt{ \frac{2K_{f}}{m} }
$$
