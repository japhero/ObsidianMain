- acceleration is the cause of an applied force 
- What are **SI units**  
- There are 4 basic types of motion
	- Linear motion 
	- Circular motion 
	- Projectile motion 
	- Rotational motion 
- this is about understanding the simple parts of very fundamental aspects of physics as to extrapolate onto the complex
- 

### Modeling 
- ***Descriptive models***: 
	- A model that simply describes the most fundamental action of some 
- ***Explanatory models***:
	- Models based on the laws of physics that have predictive power. This predictive power can then again be tested against real world data.

#### Particle model
 **When we represent an object as a single point where all of its mass is concentrated in a point.**

- The point of this model is that the characteristics outside of its position and mass aren't always important to the model so by stripping that away it becomes simpler

- Often when using the particle model in a cartesian system we use a parametric system to describe its model. In other words we dont just give positions but their time $[x,y,t]$  


#### Vectors 
- A displacement Vector is denoted by $\Delta  \vec{r}$ in this case $\Delta \vec r$ means the displacement of the vector $\vec{r}$.

- we can calculate the next position vector by doing a vector sum of the previous position and adding the subsequent displacement vector for instance:
$$
\vec{r}_{4} = \vec{r}_{3} + \Delta \vec{r} 
$$
> were $\Delta \vec{r}$ is the displacement from $\vec{r}_{3}$ to $\vec{r}_{4}$.

This could be rewritten as 
$$
\Delta \vec{r}= \vec{r}_{b} - \vec{r}_{a}
$$


#### Velocity and speed 

avg Speed = $\frac{\text{distance}}{\Delta t}$

$\vec v_{\text{avg}}= \frac{\Delta \vec r}{\Delta t}$

$\vec{a}_{\text{avg}}=  \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}$

- This difference is obviously just a result of derivative 
- Within motion diagrams an acceleration vectors relative motion to its affected velocity proportionally changes the velocity of the effected object.
	- in simpler terms if the acceleration vector is facing the same direction as the velocity vector and is half of the size of the velocity vector it will increase the velocity by the size of the acceleration vector. This gets increasingly complicated if the velocity vector and the acceleration vector are facing in different directions because this also changes the direction.

- The translation from words to symbols is the heart of problem solving in physics. 


- The book uses 4 representations of knowlege 
1. Verbal
2. Pictoral 
3. Graphical
4. Mathematical

- Problem solving approach is:
  1. Model
  2. Visualize 
  3. Solve 
  4. Review 

#### Sig figs 
- a significant figure is a figure which can be "reliably known"

- The $\sim$ is an order of magnitude estimate indicating much less confidence and precision than $\approx$ 
- 


## Definitions 
1. **Kinematics:** the mathematical description of motion
2. **Dynamics:** the explanation of motion in terms of its causes 
3. **Position vector:** A vector pointing from the origin to the position of the prescribed object, often represented as $\vec{r}$
4. **Scalar:** $\mathbb R$
5. **Vector:** A quantity having both a magnitude and a direction. EG a car going 50mph SW
6. **Time interval:** the amount of time between 2 arbitrary points in time $( \Delta t =t_{2}-t_{1})$
