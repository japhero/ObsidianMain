- acceleration is the cause of an applied force 
- What are **SI units**  
- There are 4 basic types of motion
	- Linear motion 
	- Circular motion 
	- Projectile motion 
	- Rotational motion 
- this is about understanding the simple parts of very fundamental aspects of physics as to extrapolate onto the complex
- 

### Modeling 
- ***Descriptive models***: 
	- A model that simply describes the most fundamental action of some 
- ***Explanatory models***:
	- Models based on the laws of physics that have predictive power. This predictive power can then again be tested against real world data.

#### Particle model
 **When we represent an object as a single point where all of its mass is concentrated in a point.**

- The point of this model is that the characteristics outside of its position and mass aren't always important to the model so by stripping that away it becomes simpler

- Often when using the particle model in a cartesian system we use a parametric system to describe its model. In other words we dont just give positions but their time $[x,y,t]$  


#### Vectors 
- A displacement Vector is denoted by $\Delta  \vec{r}$ in this case $\Delta \vec r$ means the displacement of the vector $\vec{r}$.

- we can calculate the next position vector by doing a vector sum of the previous position and adding the subsequent displacement vector for instance:
$$
\vec{r}_{4} = \vec{r}_{3} + \Delta \vec{r} 
$$
> were $\Delta \vec{r}$ is the displacement from $\vec{r}_{3}$ to $\vec{r}_{4}$.

This could be rewritten as 
$$
\Delta \vec{r}= \vec{r}_{b} - \vec{r}_{a}
$$



## Definitions 
1. **Kinematics:** the mathematical description of motion
2. **Dynamics:** the explanation of motion in terms of its causes 
3. **Position vector:** A vector pointing from the origin to the position of the prescribed object, often represented as $\vec{r}$
4. **Scalar:** $\mathbb R$
5. **Vector:** A quantity having both a magnitude and a direction. EG a car going 50mph SW
