- an object pulled with constant force moves with a constant acceleration


**Newton's zeroth law** 
- The object responds only to the forces acting on it at this instant. 

**Newton's First Law**
- An object that is at rest will remain at rest, or an object that is moving will continue to move in a straight line with constant velocity, if and only if the net force acting on the object is zero. 


**Newtons second law**
- An object of mass $m$ subjected to forces $\vec{F_{1}},\vec{F_{2}},\vec{F_{3}} \dots$ will undergo an acceleration $\vec{a}$ given by 
$$
\begin{array}
\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}_{net}}{m} \\
\vec{F}_{net} = m \vec{a}
\end{array}
$$


- Inertial [[Frames of reference|reference frames]] as reference frames in which Newton's first law is valid. If $\vec{a}=\vec{0}$

## Definitions 
- Mass is the amount of matter that an object contains
- The tendency of an object to resist change is called inertia
