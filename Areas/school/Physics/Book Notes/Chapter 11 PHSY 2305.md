- Force of a short duration is an impulse 

Momentum principle 
$$
\Delta p_{x}=J_{x}
$$
Total momentum of an isolated system is conserved

**Collisions**

- A large force exerted for a small interval of time is called an impulsive force


$$
md \vec{v} = \vec{F}(t)dt
$$
$$
\int_{ti}^{tf} \vec{F}(t) \, dt 
$$

**Momentum** = $\vec{p}$ = $m\vec{v}$
unit is kg m/s

- momentum can be decomposed 
- Has the same sign as the velocity vector
- This statement of the second law, saying that **force is the rate of change of momentum**


$$
\Delta  \vec{p} = \vec{p}_{f} - \vec{p}_{i} = \int_{ti}^{t_{f}} \vec{F}(t)  \, dt 
$$

**Impulse** = $J$ = $\int_{ti}^{t_{f}} \vec{F}(t)  \, dt$

$$
\Delta  \vec{p} = \vec{J}
$$
This result, called the **momentum principle**, says that **an impulse delivered to an object causes the objectâ€™s momentum to change.**
