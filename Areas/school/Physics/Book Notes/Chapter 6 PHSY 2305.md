# DUMP
- mass is loosely the amount of matter that an object contains 
- the forces acting on an object determine its acceleration $\vec{a} = \vec{F}_{net}/m$
- newtons second law can apply in component directions 
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
(F_{net})_{x}=\sum F_{x}=ma_{x} \\
(F_{net})_{y}=\sum F_{y}=ma_{y}
\end{array}
$$
- All objects have the same freefall on the same planet 

#### Types of friction

**Static**
- static force matches the applied force 
	- This static force has a max value for which after the object will "slip" denoted by $f_{\text{s max}}$
$$
f_{\text{s max}} =\mu_{s} n
$$
> $\mu_{s}$ is called the static friction coefficient


**Kinetic**
- once the box in our example slips the static force is replaced by a kinetic force. 
	- Unlike static forces kinetic forces have a nearly constant magnitude
	- $f_{k}>f_{\text{s max}}$ 
	- $\vec{f}_{k}$ direction is always going the opposite direction of the pulling force. 
	- kinetic friction is also proportional to the magintude of the normal force. 
$$
f_{k}=\mu_{k}n
$$





## Definitions 
- **Equilibrium** is when there are balanced forces and the acceleration of an object is zero. 
$$
g=\frac{GM}{R^2}
$$
> where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $R$ the radius of the planet
