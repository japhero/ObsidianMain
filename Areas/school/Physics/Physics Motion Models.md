# Constant Acceleration Model
The constant acceleration model is as said in the name the model in which acceleration is constant. This model is one of the most common models, this being because it can simplify a lot of the calculus required for changing acceleration into simple algebra.

## Constant Acceleration Kinematic equations
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v_{fs}=v_{is}+a_{s}\Delta t \\
s_{f}=s_{i} +v_{is} \Delta t +\frac{1}{2}a_{s}(\Delta t)^2 \\
v_{fs}^2=v_{is}^2+2a_{s}\Delta s
\end{array}
$$
> $s$ indicates an arbitrary direction $(x,y)$

# Uniform Motion Model 
This model is even simpler than the [[#Constant Acceleration Model]] as it assumes that velocity $(v)$ is constant 

## Uniform Motion Kinematic Equations

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v_{s} = \Delta s/ \Delta t \\
s_{f} = s_{i} +v_{s} \Delta t
\end{array}
$$

# Uniform Circular Motion 
This model is special because it unlike the others assumes not only that velocity is constant but models the "particle" to follow a circle. This circle will have a radius denoted with $r$

Within this model we use [[Polar Shapes|polar coordinates]] because of the circular nature of the model. 

**Definitions**
1. **Period:** The period is the amount of time it takes for the particle to do 1 revolution. 
2. $\omega$ (omega): is the symbol for angular velocity were positive $\omega$ is counter clockwise
3. $\alpha$ (alpha): is the symbol for angular acceleration were positive $\alpha$ is counter clockwise


## Uniform Circular Motion Kinematic Equations

$$
v= \frac{\text{1 circumference}}{\text{1 period}}=\frac{2\pi r}{T}
$$
> given the period it is very easy to find the velocity the displacement will always be the same so we just need to divide that by our **Period** to find velocity $(v)$.
