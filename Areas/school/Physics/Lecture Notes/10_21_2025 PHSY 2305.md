Hooks Law 
$$
\vec{F}_{s} = -k \Delta \vec{s}
$$
> where $k$ is a spring constant and $\Delta  \vec{s}$ is the magnitude of the displacement of the spring from equilibrium. The negative is there to show that the force goes in the opposite direction of the displacement.


#### Dissipative Forces 
this happens because of small atom size interactions, things such as vibrations

$$
E_{th} = K_{\text{micro}} +U_{\text{micro}}
$$
Within dissipative forces:
$$
\Delta E_{th} =f_{k} \Delta s >0
$$

#### Power
The rate at which energy is transferred/transformed is called **Power**:
$$
P=\frac{dE_{sys}}{dt}, \space P_{avg}=\frac{\Delta E_{sys}}{\Delta t}
$$
Unit is **watts** and is in $j/s$ or Joules per second
