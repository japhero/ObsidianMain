# DUMP
-  the integral of the velocity curve gives **Displacement**
- Within uniform motion we have a acceleration of zero 

## Questions
- Wont an integral give us a scalar, if so how come it gives us displacement?
	- For the 2d example the directionality is indicated by the sign of the integral (We either get a positive or negative integral)
