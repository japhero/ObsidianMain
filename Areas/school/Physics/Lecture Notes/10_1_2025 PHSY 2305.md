# DUMP
- Before the box slips the force of static friction $f_{s}=f_{s1 \text{ max}}$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
f_{s \text{ max}}= \mu_{s} n \\
fs\leq \mu_{s}n
\end{array}
$$


**Newtons Third Law**
- "***Every action has an equal and opposite reaction***"
- Every force: a member of an action-reaction pair of forces
	- Newtons law requires that action reaction pairs act on different objects.
$$
|F_{A \text{ on }  B}| = |F_{B \text{ on } A}|
