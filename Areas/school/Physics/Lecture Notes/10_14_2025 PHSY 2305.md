- Work is the energy transferred to/from a body/system by the application of a force.
	- Work being done to a system means energy being transferred to the system
$$
W = \Delta E_{sys} = \Delta E_{mech} + \Delta E_{th}  = \Delta K + \Delta U + \Delta E_{th}
$$

- Getting parallel component
$$
F_{\parallel} = F_{s}=F\cos(\theta)
$$
> where $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector 

- Most general form to find work
$$
W=\int_{s_{i}}^{s_{f}} F_{s} \, ds = \int_{s_{i}}^{s_{f}} F\cos (\theta) \, ds  
$$
If your force and the angle between the force and the displacement vector is constant we can simply write 
$$
W = F\cos(\theta) \Delta s
$$
