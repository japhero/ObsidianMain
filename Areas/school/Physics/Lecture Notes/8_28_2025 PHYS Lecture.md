#### **Motion diagrams**
- Motion diagrams: We overlay freeze frames of an objects motion with the same interval of time between each object
- One motion diagram model is the point model where the object is modeled by a point that moves left to right

#### Position & time
- uses a parametric system of reference (time is the variable )
- Has a arbitrary origin (t=0, (0m,0m) )
- $\vec{r}$ is the position vector
- The only concrete rule about our coordinate system is that the axis's have to be perpendicular to each other. 


#### Vectors vs. Scalars
- $\vec{r}$ is the generic position vector
- Reference [[Vectors]] for concepts such as
	- Head to tail rule 
	- Vector subtraction/addition 

- Scalars
	- described by a value 
	- can be +,-,0
	- example mass, time, speed
- Vectors
	- Described by a value with units while also specifying direction
	- magnitude: length of a vector 0,+
	- Examples position $(\vec{s})$, displacement $(\Delta \vec{s}),$ velocity $(\vec{v}_{s})$
- **Displacement**
	- change in position: $\Delta \vec{r}$
	- starting position = $\vec{r_{i}} \to$ new position $\vec{r_{f}}:\vec{r_{f}}=\vec{r_{i}}+ \Delta \vec{r}$
	- **distance** is a scalar, length of the path traveled 
	- **Displacement** is the absolute difference between the start and end point. $\Delta \vec r =\vec{r}_{f} -\vec{r}_{i}$

#### Velocity and speed
- average speed (distance $\div$ time)
- average velocity
$$
\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}
$$
- Difference is that average velocity is the displacement over time wear as average speed is the total distance over time.

- Average acceleration 
$$
\vec{a}_{\text{avg}} =\frac{\Delta \vec {v} }{\Delta t}
$$
- THIS IS CONCAVITY

## Definitions 
- mechanics: science/study of motion 
- kinematics: mathematical description of motion 
- motion: change of an objects position w/time
- Trajectory: is the path that an object follows 
	- **Translational motion**: is the motion of one place to another
