- $\vec{s}$ is a generic notation for position 
$$
\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec s}{\Delta t}
$$
-  because $r$ is a vector we know it has to be displacement and not distance
- Operationally we to get the velocity vector between 2 points we take the displacement vector and divide it by the time 
- Acceleration is found by taking the difference between 2 points velocity vectors

$$
\text{this is the propotional symbol: }\propto 
$$
- If the acceleration is constant then the object will change its velocity at a constant rate 

#### SI Units
- Most of the units we use in physics are derived from a combination of the 7 fundamental SI units

### Kinematics
- Within a position vs time graph 
	- The slope of the line created by 2 points is its average velocity 

$$
v_{s}=\lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} =\frac{\text{ds}}{\text{dt}}
$$
