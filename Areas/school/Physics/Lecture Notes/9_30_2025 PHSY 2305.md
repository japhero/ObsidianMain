- Gravitational forces act equally on each other and gravity is directional 
$$
F_{g}=G\left( \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^2} \right)
$$

**Static friction**
- static friction pushes against the direction that an object would move if i was going to move 
- Right before the object starts to move an object will reach its max static friction 

$$
F_{s} \propto F_{n}
$$
> static friction is proportional to the normal force 

$$
f_{s} \leq \mu_{s}n
$$
> its equal to $\mu_{s}n$ when the object is about to slide

**Kinetic friction** 
- this type of friction stays constant 
- $\mu_{k}<\mu_{s}$
	- Easier to keep it moving than it is to get it moving
- this type of friction is constant
