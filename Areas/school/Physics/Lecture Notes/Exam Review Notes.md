# DUMP
- IF you have a net 0 torque you can apply angular momentum 

- **perfectly inelastic collision**, two objects stick together and move with a common final velocity. 
- In a **perfectly elastic collision**, they bounce apart and conserve mechanical energy as well as momentum.




## Formula to add to formula sheet

- Ideal gass law 
- Center of mass equation 
- Both angular momentum equations 
- Kepplers laws 
-
