### Conservative forces
-  a conservative force is a force where the work done is independent of the path of thing that is applying the force 
$$
F= \frac{dU}{dx}
$$
- Stable equilibrium is a local min
- Unstable equilibrium is a local max 

basic Calculus 

when $\frac{dU}{dx}=0$ we have either a local min or max 

when $\frac{dU^2}{d^2x}>0$ we have a local min and when $\frac{dU^2}{d^2x}<0$ 



### Non conservative forces 

$$
\Delta E_{sys} = \Delta K +\Delta U =W
$$
- A non conservative force will do work to a system to change the systems energy 

$$
\Delta E_{\text{mech}} + \Delta E_{\text{th}} = \Delta E_{\text{sys}} = W_{ext}
$$




## Momentum 

$$
\vec{p}=mv
$$

- unit for momentum is $kg \, m/s$
