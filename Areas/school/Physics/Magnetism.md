$$
F_{b}=I \ell B\sin (\theta)

$$
- The centripetal force on an electron will always be in opposition to the electric charge 

$$
\vec{F}=q \vec{v} \times  \vec{B}
$$
uses the cross product to determine the new force vector

$$
F=qvB\sin(\theta)
$$
> The Lorenz force is how we define the magnetic field strength B in terms of the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field.

- Units are a Tesla
- $\theta$ is the angle between the directions $v$ and $B$

- There is no magnetic force on static charges because only charges that are moving produce magnetic fields which intern now can react to other magnetic fields.
	- **moving charges function as magnets**
- Magnetic force can cause a charged particle to move in a circular or  spiral path. 
	- This is because as the magnetic force changes the direction of the total velocity the magnetic force remains perpendicular meaning that it applys a constant rotational force to the particel.

> not perpendicular


$$
qB=\frac{mv}{r}
$$
> based on the magnetic force we can write the vector in terms of the radius

Solve fore $r$
$$
r=\frac{mv}{qB}
$$
> in this case $v$ is a vector perpendicular to the magnetic force


- if the magnetic force is not perpendicular to the total force vector you can get different shapes such as spirals.

## Right and left hand rule

- The right hand rule is a way for us to represent the directional relationship between different forces.

- the force on a wire can be represented by a hand curling in facing the direction  of the current.


## Induced current 

- If the magnitude of the magnetic **flux is increasing** in the loop, then the induced current produces a magnetic field that is in the **opposite direction** from the original magnetic field.
- If the magnitude of the magnetic **flux is decreasing** in the loop, then the induced current produces a magnetic field that is in the **same direction** as the original magnetic field.

**Flux is how much magnetic field is going through a specific point in space**

$$
\Phi = \vec B\cdot A\hat n = |\vec{B}| |\vec{A}| \cos \theta 

$$
This change in flux induces an **Electromotive** force or **emf** ($\varepsilon$). This **emf** can be represented using the formula 
$$
\varepsilon= B\ell v
$$
> Note $v$ is for velocity not voltage

This formula stems from faradays law or 

$$
\text{emf}=-N \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}
$$
