# Slicing 
Index slicing is when you use the `:` when indexing a list for example `list[n:m]`
- Starting with postion `m`
- Up to but not including `n`
- Negative indexing can also be used
Similarly to java's `substring` if either `n` or `m` isnt used it either gets the indices starting at `m` or the ones before `n`
