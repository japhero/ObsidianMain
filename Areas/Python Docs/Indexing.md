# Slicing `[::]`
Slicing contains 3 components:
- `[start::]` Start indicates the index were the returned list or item will "start" if left empty will return the list from start to the last index.
- `[:stop:]` is the index were the list will end, so the remember that this index will not be included 
- `[::step` the step is the amount of space between indicies
