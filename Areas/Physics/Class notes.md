## Simulation Questions

## Action potential
1. What is an action potential?
Electrical signals used to communicate to the Brain.  
2.  What is needed for an action potential to happen?
You need to feel some sort of stimuli or need to have some sort of innitation to start the action potential.
1. If an action potential is reached what will happen to the brain?
causes release of neurotransmitter

## Photoelectric Effect

1. What is the most important variable to get electrons to be released? 
Intensity?
2.  How does increasing the intensity of the light affect the current? 
It linearly increases it.
3. Start thinking about how eyeballs might be similar to this simulation?
Eyballs are similar as in the fact that the amount of intensity effects how much energy has passed thought he object

## Color vison

1. What color are the particles for white light? 
Any range of colors rainbow

3. When you include a lens, what color passes through it, why?
Only the color that the lense is filtering passes thought this makes sense.


# Frequency/light 
- light is a wave 
- the smaller the "curve" the larger 
- Package of entergy are called quanta (from quantum mechanics )
- when a photon or quanta hits a packet of enegry it exites the photon in the atom jumps it up to a higher electricy level 
- $E_{\gamma}=hf=h \frac{c}{\gamma}$
- Physical light is a small frequency of the light spectrum 
- The sun is white but it seems yellow because of the effects of the atmosphere.
- The frequency of the light changes weather we can see it.
- A combination of the frequency and the photons form the light. Maby like a vector
- Darkness is the absense of visible light. 

## Energy budget video
- incoming energy into the planet is diffrent for the plannent and the moon
- thermal infared radiation is the fancy word for heat.
- Planet is warming becuase more energy is entering than leaving.
- Albedo = amount of reflection 
- Difference between infared light and visible light is just the frequency of the light.


## Work function
is the amount of energy requited for a electron to jump up in orbit.
- whats Î¦ symbol?


## Paper question 
Dark paper has a higher heat potential letting it absorb more light and therefore maintaining higher heat.
