## Dynamics of Ocean waves 


&emsp;

#### **Why did you choose this phenomenon? Why should others care about it also?**
Ocean waves are an essential part of understanding how the global eco system works and i find them a good medium for me to discuss kinematic models something.



&emsp;

#### Guide Questions
- How can you model the ocean current?
- Whats the mathematical and intuitive relationship between the ocean and the moon.
- What are the ecological effects of ocean currents
- How is climate change changing the oceans.
- How do the ocean currents effect weather.


&emsp;


**What is your phenomenon? Explain how it works and what energy processes are involved. Is it biological / geological / chemical ? How and why?** 


&emsp;



**What physics equations are related to this phenomenon? And how are they related to energy principles (conservation of energy / transformations) we have learned about?** 




**Current research (< 5 years old) of the phenomenon and applications:**
