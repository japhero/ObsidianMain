# Applied Modeling of the ocean currents.
![[Pasted image 20240325142958.png|right|300]]Modeling the oceans is very important and is required for the overall understanding of our planet. Modeling in the context of the ocean means finding the velocity of the currents of the ocean. Practically we can think of this as where do the oceans go, in what direction do they move.

## Math 
One might ask how does math play a role in modeling the ocean, and that would be a fair question as there are many ways to represent the
