## Cell Size
### [Vid 2.3.1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/home?apd=6i8vabtaid&unit=2)

1. Why are cells typically small
	- Because the larger the cell the harder it is for the cell to move nutrients and waste therefore they remain small and numerous to allow for easy transfer.

2.  How is the surface area to volume ratio calculated
	- Divide the calculated surface area $(SA  = 6s^2)$ by the calculated volume $(v=s^3)$ giving ratio = $\frac{SA}{V}$


**Notes:**
- Cells are small because they are cant move large groups of things in between the cells 
- By observing the relationship between surface of effected area area and volume of the entire effected object we can assess the efficiency of the objects ability to transport things between cells.

1.  What are some examples of structural modifications of cells that increase the surface area?
	- Membrane folding increases the surface are to allow for absorption of water. Can be found in the small intestine or in plants.
2. How does the surface area to volume ratio effect the rate of heat exchange with the environment.
	- An elephant for example has a hard time exchanging heat because of its large size to surface area ratio causing the addapation of large flappy ears.
1. How are specialized structures and strategies used by cells and organisms for the efficient exchange of molecules with the environment. 
	- Villa in the small intestine are small finger like projections that help transfer nutrients in the small intestine.

## Cellular Energy
### [VID 3.4.1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=lcrjn9yiyk&status=assigned)

1. What do living things use chemical energy for?
	* Other reactions
1. How is energy efficiently transferred in a biological pathway?
	- By creating a system of chemicals reactions that operate in sequence

**Notes:**
- autotrophs capture energy from physical sources, like sunlight or chemical sources and transform the energy into energy sources usable by all cells.
- sunlight is the main energy input for living systems
- living cells are not at equilibrium.


### [VID 3.5.1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=132pi818de&status=assigned)
1. How do organisms capture and store energy for use in biological processes?
	- Photosynthesis is the process that lets organisms capture that energy 
1. How are the light dependent reactions involved in the capturing and transforming of energy?
	- Photosynthesis is the process that captures that energy and then the cell can divy up that energy to complete its functions. 
	- They use light absorbing molecules called pigments, which then takes the energy into a chemical state storing it temporally in NADPH.
		- Then facilitates ATP synthesis
1. What are the products of the light dependent reactions?
	- NAPH 
	- ATP
1. How are the light dependent reactions and Calvin cycle reactions related?
	- Because the energy used ATP is synthesized with the help of light dependent reactions and that ATP and the NADPH is then used for that reaction.
