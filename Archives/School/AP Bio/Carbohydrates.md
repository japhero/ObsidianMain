- A Polymer with a monomer called monosaccharide.
- Provide energy through Glucose
- Glucose is a simple sugar and a component of starch
- Carbs can be represented as $(CH_{2}O)_{n}$ where $n$ is the number of carbons in the molecules.  
- The ratio  of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is $1:2:1$

## **Monosaccharides**
-  Simple sugars such as glucose
- carbon = 3-7
- ends with suffix -ose 
- $\text{glucose}=C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$
- Glucose helps  make ATP

- Glucose fructose and galacose are isomers meaning they have different structures 
-  Monosaccharide can exist as a linear chain or as rings

## Disaccharides (di = two)

DisaccharidesÂ form when two monosaccharides undergo [[Macromolecules#**Dehydration Synthesis** (Put tother while losing water)|Dehydration Synthesis]]. The Covalent bond formed between the two [[#monomers]] is called a **glycosidic bond.**

## Polysaccharides 
Polysaccharides are the most common [[#Carbohydrates|carbohydrate]] found in food. They consist of long chains of [[#**Monosaccharides**|Monosaccharides]] bound by glycosidic linkages or bonds (the covalent bond between at least 1 carb monomer). This carbohydrate can react with water in a reaction know as [[#**Hydrolysis Reactions** (Split with water)|Hydrolysis]] using amylase as a catalyst. Some examples of polysaccharides are starch, glycogen and galactogen. #done



## Glycogen 
- The storage form of Glucose with a monomer of glucose which is a[[#**Monosaccharides**|Monosaccharide]].
- The animal equivalent of starch 

##  Cellulose  
- Most abudendent natual biopolymer and the main substance found in cell walls.
- Cellulose is made up of glucose monomers that is linked by $\beta \space 1 - 4$ glycosidic bonds

- Every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over and the monomers are packed  in chains.

### Chitin 
A nitrogen containing [[#Polysaccharides|Polysaccharide]] made of repeating $\text{N}\text{-acetyl-}\beta \text{-d-}\text{glucosamine}$ that is used in various Arthropods for things such as their exoskeleton.
