# DUMP 


- The body takes DNA transcribes it into mRNA and then creates proteins from that to "actually do the work"
- POL 2 is what transcribes the DNA into mRNA and functions like a "printer"
- Transcription has 5 parts
	1. Pre-init
	2. innit 
	3. Pausing
	4. Elongation
	5. Termination


### PRE-Innit  

**TATA box**
- TATA box is upstram to the coding gene 
- certain proteins can bind to repeated DNA sequences such as the TATA box
- **Transcription factor II D** binds to DNA and loads the **TATA Binding protein**  (TBP) onto the TATA box
- This creates a "foundation" for the pre-Innit Complex
- RNA POLL 2 binds onto this as well 

**Mediator**
- is  another aspect of the regulatory system considering it is used to make sure that the DNA sequence is ready to be operated on by POLL 2
- "the mediator adjust the complex enough for TFIIH to bind and start"

**POLL 2**
- Is what transcribes the DNA 

- **C-Terminal Domain**
	- Big controll rod type deal
	- Cordinates and controls transcription as it progressess 
	- its job is to get phosphorylated meaning its wants to have phosphate groups added along its long "controll rod"




**TFIIH**

- activates RNA POL II by unspooling DNA and pushing into the active site

## Innit

- After all of the [[#PRE-Innit]] **RNA POL II** leaves the [[#PRE-Innit]] complex behind

 > Looks kinda like a train moving along spitting out the RNA


### Pausing 
- RNA POLL 2 stops on its track because it needs to process the emerging mRNA
- Pausing adds a CAP to the mRNA strand
- sometimes transcription stops during [[#Pausing]] because the  cell isnt "ready" to create the respective protein 

### Elongation
- workers help unwind histones and then respools DNA once it has been transcribed into mRNA
- This takes up the majority of the transcription timeline

### Termination 
- this phase starts when the Elongation complex reaches the  3' untranslated region region of this gene
- when the complex passess into the termination the Elongation factors will  dissociate from RNA POL II
-  the  poly Adenylation signal indicates where other workers should cut off the mRNA strand
- XRN2 chops up trash RNA created after the good bit is  choped  after the ADS signal

## mRNA Post Processing 
- **Introns** are "useless" segments of the mRNA that dont code for anything and must be removed from the mRNA.
- **Exons** are sequences of the precursor mRNA that actually code for proteins, they are sliced together after the "useless" **Introns** are removed
