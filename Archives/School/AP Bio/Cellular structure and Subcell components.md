## Lesson 9/17 
- Living things are made up of 1 or more cells
- Cells are the basic unit of life
- All new cells come from old cells
- all cells need energy
- cells pass down hereditary information
- all cells have the same basic structure
	- Cells can vary in a lot of components and only really allways have 4 incomon
**Cell categories**
- Prokaryotic
	- All bacterial
	- Smaller simpler
	- No nucleus, can have a nucliod
	- DNA in a single circular strand
	- No organells except ribosomes.
	- Allways single celled organism
- Eukaryotic
	- Plants animal, fungi, protist
	- Larger than Pro
	- more complex strucutre
	- Nucleus holds DNA
	- many organelles
All cells have 
- Plasma membrane, controlls what comes in and out.
- Cytoplasm, semi-fluid, jelly like substance that holds organells
- DNA, genetic material
- Ribosomes - protein synthesisc (makes [[Proteins]])

**Cell structures**

> [!TODO] Make into "done" section using open stax textbook

- Cell membrane
- Cell wall 
	- Support (not in animal cells)
- nucleus
	- Holds DNA
- nucleolus
	- It creates ribosomes
- cytoskeleton
- ribosomes
- cilia & flagella
- endoplasmic reticulum
	- Rough or smoth makes lipids and transports protiens and lipids to the Golgi 
- Golgi apparatus
	- Modifies packages sorts lipids and protiens
- Lysosome
	- Digestive enzymes that break down old cell parts (all euk)
	- Breaks down toxic 
- Vacuole
	- Holds nutrients, water, waste (plants have one big, animals have many small)
- Chloroplast
- Mitochondria
	- Cellular resperation (all euk)
- Centrioles 
	- Cell devison (not in plants)
- Glyoxysomes
	- (plants and fungi)


## [lesson 9/19](https://virtualvirginia.instructure.com/courses/18058/pages/m2-library-2-summary-videos-and-resources-9-slash-17-9-slash-30)

- Multi cellular organisms can have specialized cells evain inside a specialized cell
- Animal and plant cells have differences and similarities
![|400](https://i.imgur.com/ZxQ46p1.png)
- Plants have one large vacuole wearase plant cells have severl smaller vaculoes
- Another difference is that most plant cells dont have lysosomes while  most animal cells do although they  can both have them

### Endosymbiotic Theory
The idea that cells absorb each other and then that the absorbed cells formed what we now know as organells.

####  Endosymbiosis 
- 2 different species depend on each other for survival
- mutually beneficial relationship in which one organism lives inside the other 
- Host cells invested both aerobic and  autotrophic bacteria

**Evidence**
-  bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplast are similar in size 
- bacteria, mitochondria and chlolplasts have DNA and ribosomes

## [Eukaryotic cells Open  stax](https://openstax.org/books/biology-ap-courses/pages/4-3-eukaryotic-cells)

- Tend to be largerand have a veriety of organells
- They most likley evolved from eukaryotes as seen becasue we can tell that the mitocondira and cloroplast have featrues of independant prokaryotes.
- Eukaryotes contain:
	- plasma membrane
	- cytoplasm
	- ribosomes  
	- DNA
- many organells are bound by membranes with  phospholipid bilayers. THis is to compartmentalize the funcition

### Nucleus 
- Houses DNA 
- Contains the [[#Nucleolus]]

### Nucleolus
- sight of ribosome assembly 

- functional ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm or attached to rough [[#endoplasmic reticulum]] where they perform protien synthesis.

### Golgi apparatus 
- Recives modifies and packages small molecules like lipids and protiens for distribution 

### Mitochondria 
-  Uses cellular respiration to capture free energy for the cell 

### Chloroplast 
- uses cellular respiration to capture free energy
