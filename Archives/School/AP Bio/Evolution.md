## [AP Daily Video 7.1 ](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=92l5sz9na3&labels=21341)
- What is natural selection?
	- Process by which organisms with adaptations suited for certain environments pass those traits on to then evolve.
- What factors influence natural selection?
	- Competition in nature for things like space food and mates
	- Favorable **phenotypes** improve survival 
- How does natural selection affect populations?
	- Reproductive sucess can effect the fitness of a population by adapting it to its environment
---
- Major mechanism of evolution
- Fitness is the ability of and organism to survive and create offspring
- Heritablility is the ability to pass on traits. 
- Ecosystem stability effects the rate of evolutions
&emsp;



## [AP Daily Video 7.2](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=ffrruk2y6g&labels=21341)
- Why is phenotypic variation important in a population?
	- Becasue this variation lets the population select for benifital traits.
- How does natural selection act on phenotypic variation?
	- adaptations due to genetic variation can change the long term phenotype of an organism
- How do changing environments apply selective pressures to populations?
	- Selective presssue: any biotic or abiotic factors influencing survivability
	- If environment changes then the fitness of an animal can change due to the new selective pressure example fur color.
- What variables increase or decrease the fitness of an organism?
	-  Its beneficial phenotypic expressions

## [AP Daily Video 7.3 ](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=7dnw4l2e0h&labels=21341)
- How can Humans affect genetic diversity within a population? 
	- Artificial selection like domestication is when people select beneficial traits in animals which gives some a artificially high chance of breeding and survival. 
- What is convergent evolution?
	- Similar environmental conditions select for similar traits in different populations
- How does convergent evolution occur?
	- When the same selective pressures cause the same outcome an example being the spine of fish.

# [AP daily Video 7.4 ](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=68eu62dmqp&labels=21341)
- What factors drive evolution?
	- Mutations and therefore random phenotypic changes.
- How do mutations contribute to natural selection?
	- because they  give the population different phenotypes to select from.
- How does genetic drift impact population size?
	- Genetic drift: Refers to the random change in frequency of a particular allele within a population. 
	- It generally decreases population as the majority of major population change events are disasters, fires, floods ect.. 
- How does the reduction of genetic variation impact populations of the same species?
	-  It can increase the differences between populations of the same species
---
- Bottle neck event is when population is severaly reduced. 
- Founder population: is when a part of the population of a speices beaks off and forms a new population. 
- Gene Flow: movement of genes between population





## [AP Daily Video 7.7: Common Ancestry](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/home?unit=7)
- What structural evidence supports common ancestry of all eukaryotes?
	- Membrane bound organs
		- Chloroplast have structual similarities double membrane etc..
	- Genes with introns
	- Linear chromosomes
		- Eukarotes Contain multiple and differ from prokaryotes

## [AP daily Video 7.9:  Phylogeny ](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/home?apd=bie7qhk6ww&unit=7)
- What are phylogenetic trees and cladograms?
	- Both show evolutionary relationships amoung linages
	- 
- How are phylogenetic trees and cladograms used to infer evolutionary relationships 
	- By observing the differences in the trees and how those relate
- How are phlogentic trees and cladograms constructed
	- By drawing Nodes and then the deviation from those nodes representing evolution
- what is a shared derived characteristic?
	- A trait a recent species has evolved from an ancestral trait 
- What is an out group, and how is it used ot infer evolutionary relationships?
	- The lineage least closely related to the remainder of the organisms 
- What is the most accurate and reliable evidence when constructing phylogenetic trees and cladograms?
	- DNA and molecular data such as proteins sequences  
- How do phylogenetic trees and cladograms illustrate speciation?
	- By showing the relationship of the new species has been seperated from the previous generation.
- Why are phylogenetic trees and cladograms constantly being revisted?
