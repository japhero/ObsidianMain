1. Use the data in Table 1 below to **construct a cladogram** of the major plant groups. (5 points)![Table 1 for cladogram assignment](https://virtualvirginia.instructure.com/courses/18059/files/73203612/preview)
2. Using the information from Table 1, which plant group would you expect to have the least amount of amino acid sequences in common with the other three groups? Explain your answer. (2 points)
3. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the sixth step in glycolysis, an important reaction that produces molecules used in cellular respiration. Table 2 below shows the percentage similarity of this gene and the protein it expresses in humans versus other species. For example, according to the table, the GAPDH gene in chimpanzees is 99.6% identical to the gene found in humans, while the protein is identical. **Draw a cladogram** depicting the evolutionary relationships among all five species (including humans) according to their percentage similarity in the GAPDH gene.

4. Using the information from Table 2, why is the percentage similarity in the gene always lower than the percentage similarity in the protein for each of the species? (Hint: Recall how a gene is expressed to produce a protein.) (2 points)
