## Forms of signaling
As stated previously there are many ways for a "sending cell" to send signals to other cells. The main difference between the different ways that cells signal to each other are the distance of the signaling.

### Paracrine Signaling
An often rare form of signaling, paracrine signaling is a very close range form of signaling that operates through the release of chemical messengers called **ligands** that can diffuse through the space between the cells.

**Synaptic signaling**![right|300](https://i.imgur.com/8DR8ghM.png)
Synaptic signaling is a form of paracrine signaling in which nerve cells transmit signals. This starts with a nuron firing an electrical impulse through the cell traveling through a long fiber like cord called an **axon** until it reaches the synapse. This then triggers the release of a **ligand** called a neurotransmitter which when it reaches the cell binds to receptors and cause a chemical change inside of the cell (often, opening ion channels and changing the electrical potential across the membrane).

### Autocrine Signaling
Autocrine signaling is when a cell sends signals to itself releasing a **ligand** that either binds internally or on its own surface. This is important for many different processes ensuring that a cell certifies its own role/identity.

### Endocrine Signaling 
Endocrine signaling is really the long distance form of signaling, using the blood stream to carry its signals. Note that because of their complexity these signals must be created using specialized cells. Signals that are produced and travel far in the body are called **hormones**.

**Ligand:** general term for molecules that bind specifically to other  molecules (such as receptors).

## Signal Transduction

### [Ap Video 4.2.1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=ooi7e9brze&status=assigned)
1. What is signal transduction?
	- They link signal reception with cellular responses 
2. Why do cells use signal transduction pathways?
	- To modify and regulate its behavior
3. How does a signal transduction pathway begin?
	- With reception of the signal ligand
4. What is the role of protein modification in signal transduction pathways?
	- Creates a shape change that intern calls for a second messenger 
5. What is the role of phosphorylation cascades in signal transduction pathways?
	- They can enhance and amplify signals during transduction.

### [Ap Video 4.3.1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=4i6urljygb&status=assigned) 

1. What role does the environment play in eliciting cellular responses?
	-  The environment characterizes the responses that the cell gives as the cells responses are responses to their environment.
	- Having effective  responses are required for survival
2. How are signal transduction pathways used to influence cellular responses when there are changes in the environment?
	- The signal transduction can change behaviors of the cell in several ways  for example modifying the gene expression to get the desired result
---
- Cells need  to regulate pathways to react  to the environment
- 



### [Ap Video 4.4](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=xcscxu7s4h&status=assigned&type=video)
1. How can mutations in the receptor protein  or any component of the signaling pathway affect the transduction of a signal?
- Because mutations can change the receptor protien effectivly blocking the signal
2. How can chemicals activate a pathway?
-  If we change the protein the effect of the protein can  activate a pathway
3. How can chemicals inhibit a pathway 
- Chemical  -> action that blocks transmition 
---
- Changes in signal transduction pathways can alter cellular response.
- 



###  [Ap Video 4.5](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/6/assignments?apd=v2tft2s9dm&status=assigned&type=video)
1. What are feedback mechanisms?
- A mechanism that reacts to its environment 
- "Balancing act"
2. How does negative feedback maintain homeostasis? 
- By decreasing a negative response to a event through. This means it accounts for an "overshoot"
3. How does positive feedback maintain homeostasis?
-  positive feedback "encourages" positive movement to optimal homeostasis.
---
- Positive feedback amplifies "good" actions. 





### 11/4 Video notes

- Chemical messenger is called the ligand
- signaling begins with the recognition of a ligand
- signals do a bunch of shit in a lot of cells that why there are so many terms
- Signal transduction, signaling pathway and signaling cascade all mean the same thing 
![400](https://i.imgur.com/OJG9Dww.png)
- binding of ligand to ligand gated channels can cause the channel to open or close.
- Phosphorylation or adding phosphate groups changes the shapes of proteins and therefore can effect weather or not a receptor and or receiver are usable
- Second messengers help spread signal  spread
- Signal transduction pathways can effect how the cell responds and this is the big picture of cell signaling 
	- For example signal transduction can change the gene expression of a cell and alter the programed response of that respective cell


**Terms**

1. **Ligand:** A chemical messenger
2. **Second messengers:** molecules that relay and amplify intracellular signals


### 11/7 Video changes in signal transduction pathways  
- Cells comunicate by generating, transmitting, receiving and responding to chemical signals 
- Change in signal molecules can effect the response
- mutations in any domain of the receptor protein or in any component of the signaling pathway may affect the downstream components by altering the subsequent transduction of the signal.
- chemicals can interfere with any component of the signaling pathway
- 

### 11/12 Video: Feedback


![300](https://i.imgur.com/cnUvtmQ.png)


1. **Negative feedback**
- maintains homeostatis
- returns system back to its target set point

2. **Positive feedback**
- amplifies
- Variable imitating the response is moved farther away from the setpoint
- Amplification occurs with a positive "outcome" amplifying much of the same

**Terms**

1. **Homeostasis:** The ability to maintain dynamic equilibrium around a set point

---

## KA 

- sending cell always as implied sends the cell they although can take different shapes such as proteins
- Not all cells can be target cells as the cell must have the right receptor ligand for it to work
