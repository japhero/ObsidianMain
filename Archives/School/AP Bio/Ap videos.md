1. How do conserved processes support the concept of common ancestry?
	- All modern systems share the genetic code creating a uniform system
	- all organisms have ribsoomes 

2. Why are these processes considered  fundamental for the processess of  life? 
	- Heritable information provides for the continuity of life 

## Video 5.3.2
1. What is mendels law of segregation?
	- A gene is a unit of heredity coding for a trait
	- a trait is a genetically determined characteristic of an organism
	- Chromosomes carry alleles, homologus chromosomes carry allels for the same trait
	- **Seperation allows for genetic variation amoung gametes**
2. What is mendels law of independent assortment?
	- One trait is not automatically inherited from another.
	- Alleles for separate traits can be packaged in every possible combination into gametes.
	- two  or more genes assort independantly of one another
3. what are a monohybrid cross and a dihybrid cross?
	- Mono $\to$ examination of how one trait is inherited
	- Dihybrid $\to$ examination of how two traits are inherited
4. How can the laws of probability be applied to genetic crossess?
	- The statistical relevance found within the crossess tells us the likelyhood of decendance
5. What is a pedigree and how  do the patterns show types of informatin?
	- Visual diagram of hereditary information
