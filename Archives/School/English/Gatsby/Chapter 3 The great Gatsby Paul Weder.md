- what are eddies of people
- Is jordan asking him to walk on the sound?
- Is nick in love with gatsby and if so why?
---
### What do you observe as significant?
- Does every chapter start or end with Some description of Gatsby.
- Constant parties of Gatsby represent materialism of the 20's?
- Nick admires Gatsby but partying all day and all night doesn't seem like an admirable trait why?
- Uses vey extravagant language to describe Gatsby and his parties. 
- Gilda Gray's
- Nick was invited to Gatsby's house.
- "Gatsby's house is that of an **amusement park**" -- weird description maybe because of the short nature of constant partying.  
- "Simplicity of heart that was his own admission" short bursts of really flavorful language somewhat like poetry. Also note that that is describing Gatsby probably why nick likes him so much
- Jay Gatsby is his full name.
- all British people are salesmen 
- Jordan shrugs off nick at the beginning of their conversation  for no reason.
- Gatsby seems consistently a good person such as described by nick in the beginning
- Gatsby is german?
- The continued theme of people looking down on west egg as lesser.
- "superior couples" describes the east egg couples 
- Gatsby was in the army.
- Nick continues to describe Gatsby in very positive ways 
	- "he smiled understanding but much more than understanding "
- Just continued change to very figurative positive tone just to talk about gatsby allmost as if he is in love with him
- His description of Gatsby is ironic considering that jordan is next to him someone that he is supposed to have affinity for.
- Gatsby's background is very mysterious first son of keiser willhelm then a german spy now an oxford man.
- Nick continues to describe gatsby like hes in love with him which makes me wonder is he in love with him
- The fact that after the party the women all fight with their husbands is indicative of the crash of the 20's at the end of the 
- shift in tone and narration to more third person.
- describes the casual parts of his life and how the events he described aren't important until later. I feel as if because he mentioned it and because he talks about more casual parts of his life he's showing that he's portraying a narative this isnt about his life this is about the "event" in the future kind-of like "looking for alaska" but less overt.
- I think its interesting that he says "i lost sight for Jordan baker" i mean he means it literally and figuratively.
- Jordan is. "incurably dishonest" god dam is that brutal.
- Nick says that he has internal checks and balances that prevent him from loving jordan baker.
- Nick also says that he writes letters to someone back home maybe implying that the roumours that he's engaged are true.
- He also says "I am one of the few honest people i have ever know" I think he means that he doesn't portray a fake image of his state of being he presents himself in true character unlike daisy or Jordan. This also furthers Gatsby because it feels like the essential character trait that nick looks for honesty is what Gatsby represents.
