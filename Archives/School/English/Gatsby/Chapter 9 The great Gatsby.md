### What do you observe as significant
- Immediate change in setting from Gatsby 
- The reports describing Gatsby's death sound like the reports of Gatsby life.
- Wilson being described as a madman is a curious description, although it's understandable that what he did was mad considering that from his perspective his wife had cheated on him with another much wealthier man and then that man had killed her. This makes his perspective more understandable, maybe not as justified.
- Also, the continued input and manipulation of slimy people such as Catherine.
- Nick feels responsible from Gatsby not having found “someone”
- Gatsby seems to have been some kind of bootlegger. 
- Gatsby's dad seems to have a completely different rendition of Gatsby than the normal “Gatsby”. 
- Gatsby had no one really that cared for him besides nick and maybe his father, considering the cold and awful attitude that others treat the now dead Gatsby with.
- Wolfsheim only values Gatsby as a business partner.
- Sky analogy for nicks attitude.
- Gatsby's father is endearing, but also seems lost in the fact that his son is dead.
- Nick withdraws back to Wisconsin.
- "After Gatsby death the east was haunted for me" Nick and daisy end their relationship, although Nick doesn't seem to care. 
- Tom seems to not have any compassion for Gatsby's death and believes that he's responsible for Daisy.
- "They were careless people Tom and Daisy they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness  or whatever it is that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess that they had made" -Nick
	- $\uparrow$ **This quote is a perfect summary of the character of Tom and Daisy to privileged and arrogant to care about others, to rich and powerful to suffer.**
- Nick describes the house as a failure because its goal (to get daisy) was a failure. 
- "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning—— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
	- Again, a beautiful quote that really highlights the features that make Gatsby such a good person in Nicks eyes, his ultimate perseverance hardship.
