# General Notes
- What is his fathers relation to the boxer in the photo?
- Acknowledges his new identity literally "This was a new beginning, and I would have to take that part of myself that looked on with remote eyes and keep it always"  this introspection seems to coincide with his awakening relative to his "blindness" as now he is able to acknowledge his changes when previously he was not.
- the policeman on the horses are a literal comparison to his current situation, black versus white.
- reference to John Brown maybe a shift to more black nationalist tactics in the brotherhood reminiscent of John Brown/Marcus Garvey.  note contrast to previous idols such as Booker T. Washington.
- what's the authors purpose in making it so the main character cannot see the crowd and comparing it to the "mechanical isolation" and a steel cage? Isn't him talking to the crowd, freeing part of that cage?
- in his speech, he's practically criticizing brother, jack along with the idea that  of being "grateful" to the extent that you don't want more freedom.
- in his speech, he makes the revelation of sight literally introspectively and externally to the crowd, explaining how he feels now that he can see
- ironic that after speech about seeing he is blind.
- a debate is had about the effectiveness of his speech I agree with the viewpoint of that people should not be moved their anger but by a value and a belief and that blind rage is a thing that in the context of a democracy has no place. Although one could argue, the main characters disenfranchisement meets the requirement of justifying change though anger not discourse.
- strangely, the narrator uses introspective rants in the same way that he used the speech (Quote 5). 
-  is the narrator trying to find a epistemic foundation through his monologue?
- ironic that he describes the narrator's new role as limited by the committee yet  "free".
-  how is the brother in financed? 
- maybe it's a strange comparison, but you could compare the brotherhood to communism with committees and boards and heavy ideological boundaries on its spokes people always controlled by some ideological police.
- ras the extortor/ras the destroyer?
- first time of a direct reference to Marcus Garvey
- Ras believes that because the "brotherhood" cooperates with White people that they are traitors?
-  throught the book there have been almost no sincere white people this furthers the point that ras was trying to make although I think it's still an incomplete one because its still very polar on race and in reality its never like that.
- The brotherhood has a military perspective on progress it's very calculated and planned.
- is the narrators time with the brotherhood another form of blindness? It's probably a step towards "sight" but not fully because of the implications of men like brother jack.
