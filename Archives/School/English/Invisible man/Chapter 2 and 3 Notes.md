**Chose a [[Themes|motif]] that is highlighted and describe the specifics of how this [[Themes|motif]] is explored and how it helps Ellison Illuminate a larger theme of the work.**

The motif that is really highlighted in this chapter are the dreams and visions; weather its Mr. Norton's dream about the school the narrators dream about his future or Trueblood's dream before he "sins". All of the dreams in these chapters are used to embed the different perspectives of invisibility. Trueblood's invisibility shows when he is   better off after his sin, he is so because helping him reaffirms the white men's perspective and blindness on the savagery of people like Trueblood and the narrator, not only are the white men blind to the caricature they believe in but they are blind to the true horror that they literally support by supporting Trueblood.

**Record 2 quotes that stand out to you as powerful / resonate with you  / impact you in some way. Explain why you chose them.**

1. *“Poor stumblers neither of you can see the other to you, he is a mark on the scorecard of your achievement a thing and not a man a child or even less a black amorphous thing and you for all your power are not a man to him but a God a force.”*

The vet describes the situation very well and this quote he shows the overarching message of the chapter the blindness of the 2 men Mr Norton blinded as said by his belife that he is bound to save all of the narrators "people", and the narrator blinded by his the same belife but inverted that the white man is all powerful and that he is a "god".

2. *"You no good bastard you get a hundred dollar bill."*

This quote is interesting because it explores a previously unseen dynamic between people that we have usually consider aligned, black people. The quote shows how the narrator was mad that the other black man had received help from Mr. Norton when he has obviously a horrible crime, it shows how the narrator doesn't understand Trueblood and how Mr. Norton still believes that he is responsible for saving everyone.

**What's a larger question about human (nature, societal structures. ect.) that Ellison forces us to grapple with in this section? Do NOT structure your question around characters or plot details from the novel; rather, what does Ellison probe us to imagine about our own life.**

How are we blind and invisible, how do we recognize our own blindness and snap out of the dream. 


# Personal notes
- what's the forbidden road and why is it forbidden
- the way the uni is described makes it seem like a dream was that intentional to represent his current state as still dreaming
- Is his "dead" life his life as an orator?
- Is a white mans burden a reference to white saviorism complex?
- Is the great founder Booker T. Washington?
- The white man founder feels as if he has a responsibility to "save" "his people" and he does so out of his own wish for gratification of his white savor complex.
- The pleasant description of fate again is a way for the writer to compare the 2 ideologies that are presented the founder representing Booker T Washington and his grandfather representing more "direct" aproach of people such as Malcom X.
- The white man brings up the first mention of "reality" as a concept like in the way that he used it later to describe invisibilty as a way to explain reality.
- Does he liken the strippers beauty to the beauty of the founders daughters.
- The white mans likens the well being of black people to his fate, i dont know if i like that, i dont know if he is just using this situation to make himself feel better because he feels he needs to save black people or if he feels a genuine want to help people. Another thing is that he uses a collective perspective of people he removes individuality maybe similar to the description of dreamers. 
- Poorer black people are likened to animals even by the main character as he describes his "pre-invisibility" days. Generally i think this story seems to be used to describe invisibly again though the lens of ignorance even of other black people. 
- Again black people are likened as a collective as when one black man does something bad, impregnating his daughter all of his kin are ashamed and embarrassed. Why does the main character view "his people" as a collective.
- why does True blood have sex with his daughter he explains how it happens but never why? 
	- Mabye the dream is him rationalizing what he did to himself so that he can convince himself that he didn't do it.
- Is Trueblood a play on words because he impregnated his daughter. 
- The white man gives Trueblood 100 dollars, this makes the main character angry for just reason as he doesn't understand why the White man gives him money and he obviously doesn't deserve it. From another perspective it makes sense to give him money as to lessen the trauma on his kids. Maby unlike the other white folk the founder doesn't use this to make himself feel superiors to black people, although he could be again plays into the dichotomy of what are the intentions and motivations of the founding white man.

Chapter 3 $\downarrow$
- is the golden Day the whorehouse and are the vets that visit the car disabled vets?
- what's the purpose of the bar scene 
- The people in the bar beat up the bouncer. I think this is used to make the men in the bar/whorehouse look as uncivilized as possible to question Mr. Norton's character. 
- He cant put his responsibility for Mr. Norton into words because he isnt invisible yet and the dynamic between the rich white people and himself/"his people" has allways been a relationship of imbalance and now that he is responsible for a rich white man makes him seem more as "just a man" not the the other adjectives of "rich", important"
- "to some you are the great white feather to others the lyncher of souls but for all your are confusion come even into the golden day"
- Dr. Bledsoe was driven out of his profession by white men who wanted to take his dignity from him. Most importantly they wanted to take his dignity not his wealth a racial divide that Mr. Norton has to grapple with.
- The doctor is out of the dream he describes the main character accurately, describing him in a dream, although he blames Mr. Norton because he believes that its Mr Nortons goal to turn black people into what the main character is a “machine”. Although the doctor accurately describes the situation, its still to me at least a mystery what Mr. Nortons goals are.
