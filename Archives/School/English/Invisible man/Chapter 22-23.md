- hes Very very introspective describing that his reaction to his grandpa was untrustworthy
- Brother Jack ungratefully mocks the narrator and is mad at him becasue he didn't ask him for guidance when gathering the croud.
- Jack thinks that Tod clifton was a traitor because he realised that he was being controlled. Brother jack wants to ostracize anyone that he doesnt agree with.
- Brother jack seems to think that because he married a black woman that he has taken part in the "black experience". Its kindov like the modern version of "how can i be racist i have black friends"
- I feel that its weird to prescribe to anyone with new ideas that they area theoretician, practically it barricades to academic terms and "academic" people. In the context of the brotherhood brother jack is saying your no theoretician what do your theories matter.
- The leg chain of brother tarp continues the symbolism of his "emprisonment".
- IM compares brother jack to a slave master over the people of harlem.
- The fact that brother jack has a glass eye is indicative of his blindness to the racial reality and to the real situation of inherent social differences in race, his constant appetite for power makes him indifferent to the cause he is fronting. 
- "Blindess; he doesnt even see me " -IM (pg 475)
- Does this mark the transition into the state of mind of the character in the beginning of the book 
- When the narrator says he doesnt see me he is talking literally and figuratively. Although the blindess that brother jack has is more obscure and confusing than other characters such as bledso or norton
- why is the narrator still parroting what the brotherhood says to ras?
- whats the purpose of the Reinheart(pure heart in german) segment? 
- Ras the Exhorter $\rightarrow$ Destroyer.
- What is IM's disguise.
- The disguise lets the narrator see what people really think about him. Its kind of sad seeing the narrators entire world colapse seeing people who he thought were his brothers racially profile him, makes me feel sympathy for him.
- Everyone keeps thinking hes Reinheart which makes me think the writer is trying to say that what the narrator is clear hearted because thats what the translation in german is.
	- Describing reinheart as heartless is ironic considering the translation
- is he a pimp?
- Im feels new freedom, is this another cycle of rebirth?
- Brother hambro describes the movement as one that tries to avoid populism and again uses the theme of science to proscribe his ideas
- it seems that IM has revelations about invisibility through his experience as Reinheart  but feels that he needs to maintain with the brotherhood because he feels he has a duty to the people that have sacrificed.
- He now is knowledgeable of his invisibility and wants to "yes" the brotherhood into destruction as he belives that brother jack and norton and emerson are all the same and need to be destroyed.
- IM thinks that if he allows the brotherhood to continue on the current path they will self destruct and therefore he will "yes" them into death.
- These chapters definitely mark a transition into the final fase of the book one of fighting under the veil of the brotherhood for the invisible and definitly marks the Birth of the character in the beginning of the book.
