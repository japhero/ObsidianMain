**Chose a [[Themes|motif]] that is highlighted and describe the specifics of how this [[Themes|motif]] is explored and how it helps Ellison Illuminate a larger theme of the work.**

I think that a major motif used in this chapter was blindness. Throughout the chapter the protagonist is blind several times i think that the blindness in this chapter us used to show the helpless ness of the main character in the literal and figurative sense. Literally because he is blind several times thought the chapter especially when he needs to defend himself. He is also figuratively helpless and blind because he is relying on the white mans scholarship to peruse his future, helpless because he is dependent on them and blind because he doesnt see the implication in their "help", or at lease he doesn't state it.

**Record 2 quotes that stand out to you as powerful / resonate with you  / impact you in some way. Explain why you chose them**

1. **" I use the phrase social responsibility and they yelled"**


I feel as if this phrase is very indicative of the theme of this chapter as in the context of this chapter it is said as a prelude to the correction of his statement from "social equality". This is relevant because he has to correct his statement form what he accidentally said because all that he is doing weather he knows it or not is saying what the white man wants to hear because they believe that he will comply to being subserviently therefore *"Someday he'll [leading] his people in the proper path"*. It all ties in the idea that he is appeasing not fighting like his grandpa asked him. 




2. **" when I reached home everyone was excited. Next day the neighbors came to congratulate me, I even felt safe from grandfather whose deathbed curse usually spoiled my triumphs"**

I feel as if this quote exemplifies more of the Maby bliss Maby stupidity of the main character to not see though the vail of obvious racism. Along with that i think it suits to contextualize the broader context of the main characters journey to invisibility that his transition was one of ** someone he might call a sleep walker as his future self.**

**What's a larger question about human (nature, societal structures. ect.) that Ellison forces us to grapple with in this section? Do NOT structure your question around characters or plot details from the novel; rather what does Ellison probe us to imagine about our own life.**  

I believe that Ellison is try to ask the reader the question what does it mean to fight, is it the literal physical fight, is it the internal fight with oneself or is it something else. 

## Personal notes/ annotations 
- "i am no one but myself" larger point about finding oneself?
- Does the grandpa represnt more of Malcom X violence. "traitor"
- does he think that him orating is going against his grandpas more violent wishes and hes afraid hes not fighting.
- Literally references himself as Booker T Washington conflicting ideas again (Grandpa vs orration)
- What does the "blond" women represent?
- The men described are Savages very materialistic and brutal
- Why are the boys forced to Box. 
- Darkness/blindness is a theme what does it represent in this contex.
	- IS it a comparison between the boys and "sleep walkers" that in a similar fasion to sleep walkers they are blind and fight out of fear?
	- Definitely a comparison to slavery in the dynamic of the situation
- Is the boxing and analagy to real action such as the speach??
- "we mean to do right by you but you have to know your place at all times"
- "Someday he'll lead his people in the proper path"
