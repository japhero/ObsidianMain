Before the 20th century, America had huge issues caused by the after effects of industrialization. The monopolization of its economy and the vast increase in income inequality, creating a new economic and social hierarchy.  As a result, from 1900 to 1920 progressive reformers and the federal government were effective in reforming politics, labor regulations and economic structures. 


The government and progressive's reformed politics, making huge strides towards more populist polices. Arguably the most successful application of this is the 19th amendment, which was brutally fought for by women's suffragists pushing the boundaries of political protest(Doc H). Other more formal reformer groups such as NAWSA and AWSA pushed also pushed Woodrow Wilson to ratify the amendment.  The 19th amendment was also a huge factor in allowing more of the general population to vote(Doc j) making the government more representative. 

The progressive movement also pushed for labor reforms, fighting against the horrible working conditions seen in several industries. Muckrakers would reveal these horrible conditions in critical expose's, one example of this is the jungle a piece exposing the horrible conditions(Doc B) of the meatpacking industry. Muckrakers, a type of progressive reformers would use these stories to push the federal government on a national level to create regulation such as the Meat inspection act or the pure food and drug act. Progressive reformers and the government would use this combination of social pressure though muckraker and legal regulations to effectively reform institutions such as the meatpacking for the better. On the contrary the labor market was still very flawed, specifically one of these flaws was the fact that child labor was still very unregulated often children would get left behind by the industrial age(Doc C). Another limitation of the reformers was that not everyone was on board, and federal labor laws against child labor would even get struck down by the supreme court(Doc G).


Finally, progressives such as Theodore Roosevelt would try to reform the country with stark economic reform. This economic reform was a liberal attempt at freeing up the markets from the stranglehold of trusts/monopolies. "Trust busting" was one of the great successes of the Roosevelt presidency(Doc A) managing to create a more liberal market. One example of trust busting was the supreme court's decision to break up standard oil in 1911. The main vehicle for breaking apart trusts was the Clayton antitrust act, which also served a dual purpose for the reformers, as it again restated the Sherman antitrust act but more importantly shored up the legal defense for labor organizations.  

Overall progressives and the federal government were able to secure a better America through their reform whether laws or social change they were able to transition America though the beginning of the 20th century to a flawed but more equal country.
