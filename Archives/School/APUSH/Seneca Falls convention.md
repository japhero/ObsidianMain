The Seneca Falls Convention was the first womenâ€™s rights convention in the United States. Held in July 1848 the meeting launched the first wave of feminism and the start of the suffragist movement. The convention opposed the viewpoint of the time that women should be domestic in nature raising children and being dependent on a man in a patriarchal society. One thing to note is that although the women agreed that women deserved the right to vote some wanted to distance themselves from the policy due to how radical that was at the time and they wanted to appeal to a large group of people.
