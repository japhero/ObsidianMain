#APUSH
Imbued with political strength in congress after the conflict with the french the federalist party began to consider ways in which to silence the Republican opposition. The result was one of the most controversial acts in American history the [[Alien and sedition acts]]. The Alien act was a piece of legislation that put obstacles in the way of foreigners specifically you had to live in the US for 14 years to become a citizen. The alien acts were targeted at the radical french. The sedition act allowed the government to prosecute anyone who was committing "sedition" against the government. This was left loosely in definition to allow the government to stifle opposition.
