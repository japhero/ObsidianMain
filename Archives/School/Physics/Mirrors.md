## [Convex  and Concave diagrams ](https://youtu.be/OHXOwz1NLh0)
- The point that all of the rays of light converge is called the

## [Spherical mirrors, radius of curvature & focal length](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

**Definitions**
- The place where all the rays of light meet is called the **focus** 
	- The distance to the focus is called the **focal length $(f)$**
- The center of the mirror is called the **pole $(P)$**
- **Center of curvature** is center of the imaginary circle created if the mirror continued using the same radius.
	- The radius of this circle is called the **radius of curvature** $(R)$

- Focal length will allways be half of the center of curvature 



## [Sign Convention for Mirrors ](https://youtu.be/Mc--Yz_YrsU)
- The same rules apply for lenses 
- Concave is when the reflecting side caves into towards the source
- Convex is when the reflecting side caves away from the source

- **Incident direction is always chosen as positive.** So for example if i have a ray pointing to the right towards a mirror then because the ray is pointing to the right the right side of the mirror will be considered positive and the left negative 



## [Mirror Formula](https://youtu.be/EPlr16b4XnQ)

**Mirror Formula**
$$
\frac{1}{f} =\frac{1}{v} +\frac{1}{u}
$$
> $v$ is image distance
> $u$ is object distance
> $f$ is focal length


- Anything past the mirror is a positive distance anything 
- Concave mirrors have a negative focal length and convex mirrors have a positive focal length
- All distances are relative to  the "pole" or the mirror.


## [Magnification Formula](https://youtu.be/FfvuY8xsO1Y)  
- Magnification formula decides the size of the image 

$$
 M  =\frac{h_{i}}{h_{o}}=-\frac{v}{u} 
$$
> $h_{i}$ is height of the image 
> $h_{0}$ is the height of the object
> $v$ is image distance  (is written as $s_{i}$ in formula sheet)
> $u$ is object distance (is written as $s_{o}$ in formula sheet)

- The magnification formula is a ratio 
	- We can use this fact to establish relationships between the object and the image
- If the sign of the magnification is positive then we have a virtual image, if the sign of the magnification is negative then we have a negative image. 
- If we factor out image hight we can create a relationship this being 
	1.  $h_{i}=M \cdot h_{o}$
	2. $h_{o}=\frac{h_{i}}{M}$
