This note is not a  lesson note but  one to figure out how to use trig  in  physics like stated.


# Dump
- We use them to find vector components or characteristics 
- Remember that trig functions only represent ratios  between functions not the length or area.
- we can find the angle of a triangle using inverse trig of the sidelengths that we allready have for example given a  triangle with a opposite side of $4$ and an hypotenuse of  $5$ we can find the angle by taking $\sin^{-1}\left( \frac{4}{5} \right)$
