- What does linearization do to the output of the equation? 
	- Does it simply reform an equation to relate variables to one another in a linear fashion. 
- we can manipulate given variables to match the transformed  values for example we if we use the identity  $x=\frac{1}{2}at^2$ to transpose that into $y=mx+b$, $y$ or $x$ has to be $t^2$ therefore if given time data we could simply square it to get what we want.
- TLDR maniplate equations to transpose them into a form which matches $y=mx+b$
