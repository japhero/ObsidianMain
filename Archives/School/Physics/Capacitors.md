**Capacitance  formula**
$$
C = \frac{Q}{V}
$$
> Where $Q$ is the charge of one side of a capacitor and $C$ is charge

Ferrad is coulomb's per charge 

if you let a battery charge up a capacitor the voltage across  the capacitor $(\Delta V)$ will  be the as the voltage of the battery

 non conducting materials placed between capacitors are called dielectric materials.  
 - Dielectric materials increase capacitance because they decrease voltage. They do this by increasing the resistance between the two polar sides of the capacitor. 

**Energy of the capacitor**
$$
E=\frac{1}{2}QV
$$ **Or**
$$
E=CV^2
$$
> This works because we substituite the capacitance formula in for $Q$. Also note that in this formula $V$ represents the voltage  across or $\Delta V$.


### capacitors in series
- Capacitors series have the same charge across the board.
- when in series we can  combine capacitors together and then use the $\Delta V$ of the  battery to  solve for charge, and because the charge of all capacitors in series has to be the same this works.
	- We call this the **"Equivalent  capacitor"**

**Equivalent Capacitor**

$$
C_{eq}= \frac{1}{\left( \frac{1}{c_{1}}+\frac{1}{c_{2}}+\frac{1}{c_{3}}+\dots \right)}
$$
