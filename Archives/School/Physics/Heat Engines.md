- work done on the gas = -work done by the gas
- if PV goes to the left the volume is decreasing and positive work is being done but if the PV diagrams path is moving to the right the PV diagram is increasing and and negative work is being done on the gas. 
- clockwise is a heat engine and counter clockwise is a refrigeration cycle 
## Equations
&emsp;
#### General Gas Law Equations


$$
PV=nRT
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
P = \text{pressure} \\
V = \text{Volume} \\
n = \text{Moles } \\
R = \text{Gass constant/}8.31
\end{array}
$$

&emsp;


$$
\Delta U= Q+W
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\Delta U = \text{Change in internal Temperature} \\
Q =\text{Heat added or removed} \\
W = \text{Work done}
\end{array}
$$
&emsp;
##### Net work **(W)** for one full cycle 

$$
W = P \cdot \Delta V
$$

> This ends up simply being the area under the heat engines PV diagram

#### **Power of piston with weight**
$$
\begin{array}{l}
P=\frac{W}{\Delta t} \\
W=\Delta U = mgh \\
P =mg \cdot \frac{h}{\Delta t} \\
P=mg \cdot\left( \frac{m}{s} \right) \\
\mathbf{\large {P=mgv}}
\end{array}
$$
> If $v$ is the velocity of the piston going upwards

## PV diagram



###  PV Process names
isobaric
- No change  in pressure (horizontal)
isothermal 
- no change  in temperature
isocloric
- No change in volume (vertical)
Ideobatic 
- no change in heat

## Heat Engine Efficiency 

**Formulas**
$$
(1)\space e=\frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{c} \\

(2):  \text{given } W =Q_{h}-Q_{c} \text{ and } e=\frac{W}{Q} \\
\mathbf{\Large{e=1-\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}}}}
\end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
e = \text{Efficency of the heat Engine} \\
Q_{c} = \text{Amount of heat flowing out of a heat engine in 1 cycle} \\
Q_{h} = \text{Amount of heat flowing into the heat engine in 1 cycle}
\end{array}
$$
