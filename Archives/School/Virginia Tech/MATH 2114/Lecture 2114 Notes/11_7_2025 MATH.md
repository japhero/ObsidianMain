- Geometric 

- Union symbol in linear algebra means items from either set. and is the symbol $\cup$ (\cup)

- In the context of subspaces what this means is to get the union we can combine the basis vectors for either set. 


#### Diagonalizing a matrix



- exponents distribute on a diagonal matrix
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}^{20} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1^{20} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2^{20} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 3^{20}
\end{bmatrix}
$$


**Theorem**
$A- m\times n$ 

A matrix $A$ is diagonalizable 

A has $n-$Linearly independent eigenvectors. 


- When checking for diagonality the geometric multiplicity matters because even though there is only one eigenvalue we care about the union of the total number of linearly independent basis for the eigenspace. 
	- So for example if given a $2\times 2$ matrix and a characteristic polynomial of $(\lambda-1)^2$ this could have a geometric multiplicity of 2 and give me the basis that i need so i must check by getting those basis vectors. 


- The degree of the characteristic polynomial tells us the size of the $n\times n$ matrix 


- How to diagonalize 

Suppose you have $A$ an $n\times n$ matrix  

Then if $\{ \vec{v_{1}}, \vec{v_{2}}, \vec{v_{3}}\dots   \vec{v_{n}} \}$ are the $n-L.I$ eigenvectors 

let $P = (\vec{v_{1}},\vec{v_{2}},\vec{v_{3}}..\vec{v_{n}})$ P is invertible and  

$$
\begin{array}{lr}
P^{-1}AP=D & &  &  \text{(where D is a diagional matrix)}
\end{array}
$$


In general, If A and B are similar 

- A and B have the same e-values 
- A is invertible if and only if $B$ is invertible

## Definitions


**Def** 
A square matrix $A$, is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matirx $P,$ where 
$$
P^{-1}AP=D
$$
> where $D$ is a diagonal matrix 


**Def**
A square matrix is a diagonal if every entry off the main diagonal is $0$ 

for example 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
is the identity matrix and also a diagonal matrix 


**Def**

We say two matrices A and B are similar if there exists invertible matrix $P$ where 
$$
P^{-1}AP =B
$$
- Practically seen this happens when 2 different variables have the same eigenvalues
