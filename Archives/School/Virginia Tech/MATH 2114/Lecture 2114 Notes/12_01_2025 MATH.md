- **<u>Rows</u>** of an original matrix are orthogonal to the vectors within the null space because by definition for the null space to be valid it must have a dot product of zero with each row. 


**Def** 
A set of vectors is an orthogonal set if each distinct pair of vectors are orthogonal



> [!definition] Vector Norm
> The norm of a vector $\vec{v}$ is 
> 
> $$
> ||\vec{v} || = \sqrt{ v_{1}^2 + {v_{2}}^2+ \dots v_{n}^2}
> $$


> [!DEFINITION] **: Orthonormal basis**
> A basis for $w$ that is also an orthogonal set, and where each vector has norm 1, is called an **orthonormal** basis. 


- Norm squared is the dot product of itself 



> [!definition] Orthonormal compliment 
> 
> Given $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a S.S 
> 
> Define the orthogonal complement of $W$ as $W^{\perp} = \{  \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n |  \vec{x} \cdot   \vec{w} =0  \text{  for every } \vec{w} \in W \}$

- Practically this means that the vectors within the orthogonal compliment are perpendicular to every vector of the original $W$. 


- To find the orthogonal compliment find the null space of the transpose of the vector 


> [!definition] 5.2: Orthogonal Decomposition Thm
> suppose $W \subseteq  \mathbb{R}^n$ is a S.S and $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
>
> Then there is exists unique vectors, $\vec{w} \in W$ and $w^\perp \in W^\perp$ where $\vec{w}+\vec{w}^\perp= \vec{x}$






**Statement**
- If $W$ is a subspace then so is the compliment
- $W \cap W^{\perp} =\vec{0}$
- If $w = \text{span} (\vec{v_{1}},\dots \vec{v_{k}})$, then $\vec{x} \in W^{\perp} \in  \vec{x} \cdot  \vec{v_{i}}=0 \text{ for all } i$
- $(w^ \perp)^\perp =w$
