# Outline 

## Thesis 
- Keynesianism and neoliberalism are vastly different and fundamentally different schools of economic thought. Their differences although can be chalked up to a fundamentally different interpretation of the power of markets, Keynesianism comes out of a disagreement with the neoclassical notion that the "invisible hand" of the market will adjust for the best outcome for the consumer. This difference although is not only one with neoclassical economics but also with neoliberalism as these philosophies both shaped the US economy over the 20th century going from reinvestment and assistance programs like the New Deal to international trade policy like NAFTA. 


## Introduction
- Give thesis and introduce historical differences from Keynesianism to neoclassical economics


## 1930's era and the introduction of Keynesianism 
- Millitary keynsiansim with governmental stimulus through investment into millitary production 
- New deal, introducting the 3 letter agencies that focused on reinvestment into the economy through infrastructure and assistance programs 
	- TVA: tenesse vally authority 
		- investment programs 
	- Hoover dam 
- make sure to point out that keynesanism fundementally had a distrust that markets would create a benifiital economic outcome for the population.



## 1970's to 2000

- neoliberalism was not only a national movment but also an international movement and influenced by competition with the USSR as the US tried to push capitalism through instiutions like the IMF and world bank 
	- Structual reajustment loans perfect example of globalization and shifted direct US influence in globalization of markets
- **1970s Crisis:**
	- Stagflation: simultaneous inflation and unemployment
	- Productivity decline
	- Global competition intensifies
	- Oil crises (1973, 1979)
	- Baby boomers enter labor market
- Neoliberalism fundamentally relies on trust in the market hands and frees up capitial to financialize markets not only within the US but globally 
- 

- **Monetary Shift (1970s-1980s):**
	- 1971: Nixon ends gold standard → fiat dollar
	- 1974: Petrodollar system established
	    - OPEC prices oil in USD
	    - Dollar becomes global reserve currency
	    - "Dollar-Wall Street regime" (Arrighi)
	    - U.S. can borrow cheaply, run large deficits

- **Reagan Era (1980s):**

	- Paul Volcker's high interest rates to combat inflation
	- Supply-side economics and monetarism
	- Tax cuts for wealthy
	- Deregulation, especially financial sector
	- Recharged military spending (despite small-state rhetoric)
	- Anti-union policies

- **Financialization Process:**

	- Capital flows into U.S. economy
	- Asset bubbles replace productive investment:
	    - Stock market bubble (burst 1987)
	    - Dot-com bubble (burst 2000)
	    - Housing bubble (burst 2008)
	- Financial sector grows relative to productive economy

- **Clinton-Bush Era (1990s-2000s):**

	- "Globalization" ideology emerges
	- Capital market liberalization prioritized
	- Continued financial deregulation
	- NAFTA and trade agreements
	- Fed becomes primary economic manager
	- Credit-fueled consumption replaces wage growth

# Structure 


## Thesis 
Development and underdevelopment are not separate stages on a linear path but mutually constitutive processes within the capitalist world-system: the wealth and industrialization of core nations has historically been built upon—and actively required—the extraction and subordination of peripheral economies. However, successive waves of contender development are progressively weakening this hierarchical relationship, spreading productive power more widely and moving the world toward a multipolar order where such stark unevenness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain.


### Historical Formation of the current world order relative to capitalism and how it developed 
- Innitially through millitary and economic power briitan and other western countries maintained the core periphery dynamics by introducing strict restrictions on the market.
	- Opium war is a good example of this forcefull implementation 
- Industrial development globaly then spread out the global productive power and made was the worlds first "multipolar" moment 
- As the world continued on this cycle these patterns continued with "multiploar" moments continuing to distribute the allocation of capital and productive power among an increasingly large number of "poles". 
- In our modern world system this is clearest with the example of china which uses an aproach almost remincent of Fredrich List in the sense that it creates entry barries into its economy ususaly sharing industrial secrets with a chinese partner company before being able to develop productive capacity within china or being to sell items there. 
 
 
### Mechanisms of development and  underdevelopment interlinked through globalism and capitalist formations 
- Capitalism incentivizes the movement of capital and productive power and as capitalist tendencies are freed through movements like neoliberalism and players like the IMF and world bank. 
	- Structural readjustment programs are a good example for how globalism allows capital movement and creates systemic inequities within the world system/creates core periphery dynamics. 


### Modern developmental transformations within the world system 
- Chinas development as the predominant industrial power emerges with other "new" powers like india playing a much larger role in the global economy than before 
- Using worlds system theory we can state that China and India have become essential semi-periphery countrys as they develop their own capacity to produce and sell some of the most valuable goods. 
- We classify china and india as semi-periphery countries because they still dont produce the most valuable products such as software or semiconductors at the same rates as current western powers like Norway or the united states. Although it can be debated that china in particular has become a core country.
- The BRICS aliance is a good example for the shifiting dynamics of global power as emerging economic players who traditionally could have been consider underdeveloped like brazil, russia and india try to use their economic power to influence the world system. 
	- Some sugested policies are indictive of this shifting global dynamic, the best example is the sugestion to move away from the dollar a symbol of US hegemonic power and a pilliar of US and global fiscal policy and of global bond markets.
