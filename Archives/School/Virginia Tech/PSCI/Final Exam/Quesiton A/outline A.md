# Outline 

## Thesis 
- Keynesianism and neoliberalism are vastly different and fundamentally different schools of economic thought. Their differences although can be chalked up to a fundamentally different interpretation of the power of markets, Keynesianism comes out of a disagreement with the neoclassical notion that the "invisible hand" of the market will adjust for the best outcome for the consumer. This difference although is not only one with neoclassical economics but also with neoliberalism as these philosophies both shaped the US economy over the 20th century going from reinvestment and assistance programs like the New Deal to international trade policy like NAFTA.
