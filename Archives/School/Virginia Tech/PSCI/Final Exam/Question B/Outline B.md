# Structure 


## Thesis 
Development and underdevelopment are not separate stages on a linear path but mutually constitutive processes within the capitalist world-system: the wealth and industrialization of core nations has historically been built upon—and actively required—the extraction and subordination of peripheral economies. However, successive waves of contender development are progressively weakening this hierarchical relationship, spreading productive power more widely and moving the world toward a multipolar order where such stark unevenness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain.


### Historical Formation of the current world order relative to capitalism and how it developed 
- Innitially through millitary and economic power briitan and other western countries maintained the core periphery dynamics by introducing strict restrictions on the market.
	- Opium war is a good example of this forcefull implementation 
- Industrial development globaly then spread out the global productive power and made was the worlds first "multipolar" moment 
- As the world continued on this cycle these patterns continued with "multiploar" moments continuing to distribute the allocation of capital and productive power among an increasingly large number of "poles". 
- In our modern world system this is clearest with the example of china which uses an aproach almost remincent of Fredrich List in the sense that it creates entry barries into its economy ususaly sharing industrial secrets with a chinese partner company before being able to develop productive capacity within china or being to sell items there. 
 
 
### Mechanisms of development and  underdevelopment interlinked through globalism and capitalist formations 
- Capitalism incentivizes the movement of capital and productive power and as capitalist tendencies are freed through movements like neoliberalism and players like the IMF and world bank. 
	- Structural readjustment programs are a good example for how globalism allows capital movement and creates systemic inequities within the world system/creates core periphery dynamics. 


### Modern developmental transformations within the world system 
- Chinas development as the predominant industrial power emerges with other "new" powers like india playing a much larger role in the global economy than before 
- Using worlds system theory we can state that China and India have become essential semi-periphery countrys as they develop their own capacity to produce and sell some of the most valuable goods. 
- We classify china and india as semi-periphery countries because they still dont produce the most valuable products such as software or semiconductors at the same rates as current western powers like Norway or the united states. Although it can be debated that china in particular has become a core country.
- The BRICS aliance is a good example for the shifiting dynamics of global power as emerging economic players who traditionally could have been consider underdeveloped like brazil, russia and india try to use their economic power to influence the world system. 
	- Some sugested policies are indictive of this shifting global dynamic, the best example is the sugestion to move away from the dollar a symbol of US hegemonic power and a pilliar of US and global fiscal policy and of global bond markets.
