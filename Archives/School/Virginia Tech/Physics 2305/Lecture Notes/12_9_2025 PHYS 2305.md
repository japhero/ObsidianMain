$$
\Delta E_{th} = W +Q
$$
- $W$ in this situation means the work done by the outside 


$$
W_{ext}= -\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}} p  \, dV= -W_{gas} 
$$
- If Q is positive then heat flows into the system $(Q>0)$
-  1000 cal = 1Cal or Kcal/kilo calorie 


- material specific heat: $Q=mc \Delta T$
- is the amount of heat that needs to be put into a 1kg object to change its temperature by 1 kelvin

$$
\Delta E_{th}=mc \Delta T
$$

**Different specific heat constants**

- specific heat at its core is the amount of heat required to change the the temperature of an object by a cirtain amount (molar vs mass based)
- Because a gas can behave differently when heated we have 2 speicifc heat constants 
	- Specific heat at a constant volume $(c_{v})$  
	- Specific heat at a constant pressure $(c_{p})$
- for an ideal gas we can relate this with:
$$
c_{p}-c_{v}=R
$$
- Molar vs mass specific heat
	- Molar specific heat is the amount of heat required to increase 1 mole of an object by 1 kelivn
	- Mass specific heat is the amount of heat required to increase 1 kg of an object by 1 kelvin
