- Generally our moment of inertia will be given by 
$$
I=cmr^2
$$
> Where $c$ is an arbitrary constant representing the distribution of mass on an object and $r$ is an arbitrary distance vector. 

- Moment of inertia at the center of mass will be the smallest moment of inertia

**Parallel axis theorem**
$$
I=I_{cm} +Md^2
$$
> $cm$ subscript indicates that the axis is around the center of mass. 

- What this is practically saying is that given the impulse around the center of mass any impulse given around an axis that is parallel to axis given around the center of mass can be given by multiplying the mass of the object by the distance between the center of mass and the new axis squared eg $(Md^2)$ 

### Rolling Motion w/o Slipping
- The main condition relationship given is 
$$
v_{CM} = \omega R
$$
> $v_{CM}$ is the velocity of the object relative to center of mass.


-  The point at the ground is momentarily at rest relative to the ground

## Cross Product 
- The resultant vector of the cross product is the vector perpendicular to the plane that contains both original vectors. The direction depends on the order of the vectors with 2 vectors in the counter clockwise direction 


## Torque $(\tau)$

given that $r$ is the vector pointing from the pivot to the point where the force $F$ is applied. 

$$
\begin{array}{\ll}
\tau=rF\sin(\theta) \\
\tau=r \times F
\end{array}

$$

- if the torque causes counter clockwise rotation then it is considered a positive torque $(+\tau)$ 


**Moment arm**
- the moment arm is the distance between the pivot point and the line of action. 


- The place where the torque is applied matters given a rigid body we can represent this as 
$$
\tau_{net} = I\alpha
$$
