### Conservative forces
-  a conservative force is a force where the work done is independent of the path of thing that is applying the force 
$$
F= \frac{dU}{dx}
$$
- Stable equilibrium is a local min
- Unstable equilibrium is a local max 

basic Calculus 

when $\frac{dU}{dx}=0$ we have either a local min or max 

when $\frac{dU^2}{d^2x}>0$ we have a local min and when $\frac{dU^2}{d^2x}<0$ 



### Non conservative forces 

$$
\Delta E_{sys} = \Delta K +\Delta U =W
$$
- A non conservative force will do work to a system to change the systems energy 

$$
\Delta E_{\text{mech}} + \Delta E_{\text{th}} = \Delta E_{\text{sys}} = W_{ext}
$$




## Momentum and Impulse 

$$
\vec{p}=mv
$$

- unit for momentum is $kg \, m/s$

**impulse-momentum theorem**
$$
J_{s}=\Delta p_{s}
$$

- Because of the newtons third law the impulse done by an object is negative because the force that it creates must be equal and opposite to the object it is done on. 
$$
J_{\text{A on B}} =-I
$$
