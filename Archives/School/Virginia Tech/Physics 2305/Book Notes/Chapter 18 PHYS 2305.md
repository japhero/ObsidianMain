# Section 18.1
- Phase change is when a substance changes between phases of matter
	- Water is the only material where all three phases are common 
- The parameters used to characterize or describe a macroscopic system are called **state variables**.

**Density equation**
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V}
$$
> $M$ for mass and $V$ for volume 

- A system is in thermal equilibrium if its state variables are constant and not changing
- Order of magnitude symbol is $\sim$  (\sim) and means that the quantity is within an order of magnitude (factor of 10) of the given number 
	- $x \sim 55$ means $x$ is within an order of magnitude of $55$

**Number density**
$$
\begin{array}{rr}
\displaystyle\frac{N}{V} \space  &  &  \text{(number density)}
\end{array}
$$


- Sum of protons and neutrons is called the **atomic mass number** 
	- Is written as leading superscript exe $^2H$ 


- The atomic mass of any other atom is its mass relative to $^{12}C$ 

- The molecular mass is the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms forming the molecule.

**atomic mass to $kg$ conversion** 
$$
1u=\frac{m(^{12}C)}{12}=1.66 \times 10^{-27}kg
$$
- if specified in $kg$ then we can find the number of atoms or molecules in a system of mass $M$ with
$$
N=\frac{M}{m}
$$

- A mole is a way of measuring the amount of substance in something 
$$
1\text{ mole} =6.02 \times {1}0^{23}
$$
- **Monatomic** atoms are atoms like helium where the total number of atoms in that substance are the same as the number contained within 1 mole of that substance
- **Diatomic** atoms are atoms in which the basic particle contains $2$ molecules for example $O_{2}$ this means $1$ mole of oxygen contains $2\times 6.02\times 10^{23}$ molecules 

- The number of basic particles per mole of substance is called Avogadro's number

$$
N_{A} = 6.02 \times 10^{23} \,  \text{ mol}^{-1}
$$
**Number of particles contain $N$ basic particles**
$$
n= \frac{N}{N_{A}} 
$$

- Molar mass is the mass of $1$ mol of substance 
	- This means we can rewrite the equation above as 
$$
n= \frac{M}{M_{mol}}
$$


# Section 18.3 Temperature

- Temperature is the average kinetic energy of the particles within it 
- $E_{th} =0$ is called absolute zero 


**Kelvin to Celcius**
$$
T_{k} = T_{C}+273
$$
> This is temperature on the absolute scale because absolute zero is $-273$




# Section 18.4 Thermal Expansion 


**Objects change in temperature related to change in length**
$$
\frac{\Delta L}{L} = \alpha \, \Delta T
$$
> where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion

- This can also be done with volume 

**Objects change in volume relative to temp**
$$
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \beta \Delta T
$$
> $\beta$ is the coefficient of volume expansion


- using $dV=3L^3dL$

$$
\beta_{\text{solid}} = 3\alpha
$$

# Section 18.5 Phase Changes

- Phase Change where gas turns into a gas is called **sublimation**


# Section 18.6 Ideal Gases 

- An gas of the idealized form of an Atom eg one consisting of small round solid balls is called an **Ideal gas** 
- Ideal gas is a good model if:
	- the density if low 
	- The temperature is well above the condensation point 


**Ideal gas law**
$$
pV = nRT
$$
> $R$ is the universal gas constant and is $8.31 \,   J /\text{mol }K$


- Conservation version

- If we want to do the ideal gas law in terms of the number of number of molecules we use boltsmans constant
$$
k_{b} = \frac{R}{N_{A}} =1.38 \times {1}0^{-23}
$$

# Section 18.7

- isochoric process means volume is constant
