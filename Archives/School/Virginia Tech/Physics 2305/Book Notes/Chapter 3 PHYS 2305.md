-  This chapter is basically [[Vectors]]
- when solving for displacement $\Delta \vec r$  and given a time and speed $\Delta \vec r =\Delta t(\vec{v})$ 
- In physics we separate out component vectors from directional vectors. 
	- $\vec{A}_{x}$ is a component vector 
	- $A_{x}$ is a component

## Definitions
$$
\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec r}{\Delta t}
$$
> where $\Delta \vec r$ is the total displacement (it has a direction, which is also indicated by the fact that its a vector)
