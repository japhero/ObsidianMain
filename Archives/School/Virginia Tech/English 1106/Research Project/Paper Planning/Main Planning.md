## Thesis 




**Tentative Thesis** 

Students who actively invest and adapt to the new learning environment by choosing active study methods will academically outperform students who do not. Additionally, as students transition from high school to college, some students will adapt their studying methods by using more digital technology and external studying tools.


**Rework**

When students transition from high school to college their learning environment changes significantly, students who accept this change by learning new studying techniques and other learning related skills will out perform students who learn the same way they did previously. 

## New Research Question brainstorming 

- **Why do some high-performing high school students struggle despite adapting?** (What are they adapting _wrong_?)
- **Is the transition really about study techniques, or is it about learning to teach yourself?** (The autonomy question)
- **Do time management changes matter more than technique changes?** (Your data could actually speak to this)
- **What prevents students from adapting when they know they should?** (Several students agree they need to study more but haven't changed their methods - why?)



**Is the transition really about study techniques, or is it about learning to teach yourself?** 


**Relative thesis**


**What am i trying to say**

When students transition from highschool to college the level of relative academic skill offten doesnt matter when the most important adaptation for this transition is to learn how to mange time and teach yourself material that you arent 100% proficient in 


While High School teaches students under a rigid structure this structure creates a systemic skill gap as students reach College. Even the top performing students can fall through if they dont learn to adapt to the comparatively lose structure of college by learning to teach themselves and manage their time. 


High schools rigid structure systematically prevents new college students from developing 


High school's rigid structure systematically prevents students from developing self-regulation skills. When these students reach college, even top performers struggle because college demands the autonomous learning abilities—self-teaching, time management, and planning—that high school never required them to develop.
