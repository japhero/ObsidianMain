- This is meant to be a 5 week course to teach people how to code for FTC

# Week Overview 

**Week 0:** (Optional week) that goes into integrating ENG 1&2 into basic java syntax and explain the FTC java filesystem eg opmodes, teleop and Auto 

**Week 1:**  [[First Lessson plan--Thory|Theory]] 

**Week 2:** [[Second Lesson Plan--State Machine|State machine]]

**Week 3:** Roadrunner 1 

**Week 4:** Roadrunner 2 

**Week 5:** Make your own Controller 
- this weeks goal is to split up the group into 2 groups, one group that creates an auto strategy and then then subsequent actions. These actions would use methods from the teleop Group and therefore a large part of this assignment relies on the groups communicating together correctly.
