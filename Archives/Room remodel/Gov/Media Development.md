### WW 2 video 
- Propoganda video for the american military 
- Props up the civilian wing of the military effort (arsenal of democracy) 
- When the video uses the defence of democracy as a justification of americans actions its effective because it uses something that americans value rather than an arbitrary feeling that americans dont know.


### JFK vs Nixon 
- JFK uses an appeal to previous leaders (FDR) to associate himself with the positive image of those leaders
- JFK uses direct appeals to policy 
- The debate remains respectful and the moderators managed to ask hard hitting questions.
- Different news outlets covering the debate and asking questions.

### CNN's First broadcast 1980
- We heard the background comments before it started
- It was a quick bullet point style news reel.
- Some bad orator was talking about news reels
- Statements written on the note cards rather than teleprompters.

### Election Night 1984  
- the music is way better 
- The commentary is way more factual than today as today its a lot more  analysis 

### Tucker Carlson 
- Hes very biased and picks and choses facts to represent his view
- His show is entertainment and is very emotional making a LOT of apeals to "core" american values the "libs" are trying to take away your freedom of speech.
