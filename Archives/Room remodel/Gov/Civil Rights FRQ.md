_"The rights of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."_ **The Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, 1870**

**Prompt:**  Although the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, voter turnout among black citizens was very low throughout the first half of the twentieth century. Over the past several decades, civil rights policies have changed substantially -- and we've seen a significant increase in African American voter turnout.


## (A)
**Explain** how TWO measures that states took before the 1960's affected voter turnout among black citizens.


Before the 1960's souther states used impossible literacy tests to try and limit the turnout of black Americans. These tests where made to fail and would let the staff working the voting station discriminate based on race through the subjective result of the literacy test. These same states also used the grandfather rule to achieve a similar result, this "test" requiring that only people who had grandfathers who could have voted could also vote this meant that all the newly emancipated slaves couldnt vote as their grandfathers where slaves.


## (B)

In the face of discrimination at the voting booth, many black voters turned to alternative forms of political participation. **Describe** **TWO alternative** forms of participation that helped bring about changes in civil rights policies.


Civil disobedience in the forms of protest was a major factor creating not only national attention to the issues of black Americans but putting political pressure on the legislators that created racist Jim crow laws. Another action that help was participating in targeted law suits, rosa parks being the best example. These law suits brought the illegal laws infront of a jury and a judge and forced states where these laws could stand to contend with the supremacy clause of the united states. 


## (C)
**(C)** Choose **ONE** of the forms of **participation** you described above and **explain** why it was **effective** in changing civil rights policies.

Civil disobedience was extremely effective as we can see the fruits of its labor in law to this day more specifically the civil rights act of 1964 was a direct result of political protest and the pressure on both democrats and republicans that resulted. Some famous protests included the march on Washington and the bussing protests where protesters would bus themselves down to southern states and then when locals confronted them they would violently these stories made national news and put pressure on congress and LBJ.



## D
**(D)** **Identify** **ONE barrier** that _currently_ hinders minority representation in Congress. **Explain** why the barrier you identified inhibits minority representation in Congress.

Gerry madering is one of the major barriers that prevents minority representation as states have historically and still to this day tried and succeeded in making state lines fall along racial lines as even in the last 5 years redistricting of Georgia was struck down by SCOTUS.
