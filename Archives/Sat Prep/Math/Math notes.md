- to get a slope perpendicular to the one given get the inverse reciprocal. Example $\frac{4}{5}x \to -\frac{5}{4}x$ 
- No solution in the context of systems of equations is when both equations dont intersect when graphed typicaly seen with parallell lines.


## Absolute value

- ususally have 2 solutions
- plug in the values given int o desmos or into the fucntion and then just solve to see if the answer is correct
- Do the old $y=a$ trick to find were a function equals a value
- **to solve algebraically for the 2 values just set quantity under the absolute value to a negative and solve and then to a postive and solve this will solve for both answers**
- when it gives you an absolute value equation and then says what is the positive/negative value of another equation its asking you to solve the absolute value equation then use the positive or negative value found when solving and then substitute for x.
	- EXAMPLE: If $\mid x-5\mid =20$ what's the negative value of $x+5$?
	- Solve for the negative value and then substituite into $x+5$


## Core Math
Basically math word problems

Have to be able to do 3 things
- Evaluate Sample
- Draw conclusions from the data
- Describe the margin of error
- Give a summary


### Evaluate
We can use different criteria to evaluate if the sample is good it has to be 
- **Random**
- **Representative**
we can use that criteria to evaluate if the sample is good
### Margin of Error
SAT, questions will not ask us to figure out the value of a margin of error. Instead, they will ask us to interpret a given margin of error.
  $(Value \space \pm \space Error)$

TRICKS
- Note we can only generalize for the sample taken 
- Sample size is almost never the problem 

### Inequalities 
- when dividing or multiplying by a negative number on both sides you have to flip the inequality 
- inequalities represent a range of numbers



## statistics 

### Standard deviation 
Standard deviation measures the _typical spread_ from the mean; it is the average distance between the mean and a value in the data set.
- sat wont ask you to calculate the standard deviation
- 

### Mode
the mode of an equation is the value with the most occurrences. 


### Calculate a missing value using the mean 
1. calculate the sum of values by multiplying the mean by the number of values 
2. Subtract all know values from the sum of values.

# Polynomials
- Zeros = x values that make the polynomial equal to zero.
- The y intercept of polynomials is always determined by the constant term (or $c$ in standard form) because when x is zero all of the terms with coefficients go away.
	- $x^3+2x-5x-6$ has a y intercept of 6
- Highest power term tells us end behavior. For the term $ax^n$


| $a>0$ (positive)                 | y aproaches positive infinity                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| $a < 0$ (negative)               | y aproaches negative infinity                |
| $n \in 2\mathbb Z$ ($n$ is even) | the graph ends point in the same direction   |
| $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ ($n$ is odd)  | the graph ends point in different directions |


### Polynomial remainder theorem 
- Polynomial remainder theorem says that if we take a polynomial and divide it by $(x-a)$ then the remainder is going to be $f(a)$

> [!EXAMPLE]- Proof using an example: ${{3x^2-4x+7}}$ and $({x-1})$ as $(a-1)$
> As the [[Polynomial Remainder theorem|theorem]] says if we take the equation and divide it by $(x-1)$ then it should be the same as plugging in 1 into the equation. So to start we have to take long devision of $\frac{{3x^2-4x+7}}{x-1}$.
> $$
> \begin{array}{rr}   
> x-1\enclose{longdiv}{3x^2-4x+7} \\
> \underline{-(3x^2-3x)} \\
> {-x+7} \\
> {-(x+1)} \\
> \hline {6}
> \end{array}
> $$
> Now we just check by actually plugging it in.
> $3(1)^2-4(1)+7=6$
> this proves that the theroum is correct as we got 6 both times


> [!TODO]- Candidate for Full note [[Polynomial Remainder theorem]]
> Conains a formula/method but idk if it should go in the subfolder




## [[Factoring polynomials]]

### Formulas 
$a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2$
$a^2-2ab+b^2=(a-b)^2$
$a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$
