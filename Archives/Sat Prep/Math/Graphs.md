## quadratic graphs
- it is a parabola
- Vertex = point where the derivative changes
- can use the discriminant on the quadratic function to know how may solutions there are

Using $ax^2+bx+c$
- If $a>0$ then the parabola opens up in the positive direction while if $a<0$ then it opens in the negative direction
- $a$ also describes how steep or shallow the parabola is. 
	- Larger = more steep
	- Smaller = shallower

| Form of the quadratic equation   | Equation      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Standard Form                    | $ax^2+bx+c$   |
| Factored Form  ($b,c =$ zeros)   | $a(x-b)(x-c)$ |
| Vertex Form ( Vertex = $(h,k)$ ) | $ax(x-h)^2+k$ |

**Replicating a Parabola**
- Plug in the vertex values to the vertex Form of the quadratic equation
- plug in the root and solve for a
- write the finished equation
- Remember when the equation opens upward this means that the vertex is the min point.

When we're given a quadratic function, we can rewrite the function according to the features we want to display:

- **$y$-intercept:** standard form
- **$x$-intercept(s):** factored form
- **Vertex:** vertex form

**shifting parabolas**
$f(x-4)$ shifts 4 to the right
$f(x+5)$ shifts 5 to the left
$f(x)+2$ shifts up 2
$f(x)-4$ shifts down 2

The graph $y= -f(x)$ is the graph of $f(x)$ reflected across the $x\text{-axis}$ - 
The graph $y= f(-x)$ is the graph of $f(x)$ reflected across the $y \text{-axis}$ 
The graph $y=c \cdot f(x)$ is the graph of $f(x)$ stretched **vertically** by a factor of $c$.
