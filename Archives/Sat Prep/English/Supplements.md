## Essential Elements 
Essential elements are elements which convert information that is necessary for the sentence to function and makes sense. The most important thing to remember about essential elements is that they don't require punctuation. 

&emsp;

> **Example:** In a basketball game, ==the team that scores the most points== will win.

&emsp;
## Nonessential Elements 
nonessential elements are elements which do not convey information that is necessary for the sentence to function. These elements are the only elements that require punctuation change. To correctly punctuate nonessential elements simply surround the element with one of 3 punctuation marks.
1. Commas (,)
2. Parentheses ()
3. Dashes ()
**Remember punctuation must come before and after the [[#Nonessential Elements|Nonessential Element]] unless it starts or ends the sentance** 

&emsp;

> **Example:** The basketball team==, which won the state championship last year,== got on the bus.

&emsp;
## Strategy 
when approaching supplement questions you should allways try to first figure out where the element is and if it is essential. After you classify the element find the choice that correctly
1. Uses the correct punctuation 
2. Places the punctuation in the correct place


# Dump
- Supplements are words, phrases and clauses that add extra information to a sentence, often for the purpose of description or elaboration. There are 2 main types of Supplements 
1. **Essential elements** are necessary for the sentence to function and dont require punctuation.  
	- **Example:** In a basketball game, the team ==**that scores the most points**== will win.
2. **Nonessential elements** are _not_ necessary for the sentence to function. They must be separated from the main sentence by punctuation.
	- **Example:** The basketball team, ==**which won the state championship== last year,** got on the bus.
- Main difference is that if the information is essential to the sentance to make it work it doesn't require punctuation while a nonessential element requires punctuation. 
- **How are supplements punctuated**
	- If the sentence makes sense without the supplement it must be separated by punctuation otherwise don't punctuate
- **Position in the sentence** of nonessential supplements 
	-  If the supplement begins or ends the sentence, it only requires one punctuation mark (between the supplement and the rest of the sentence).
	- If the supplement comes in the middle of the sentence, **it requires punctuation on both sides.**
## Types of punctuation 
 Nonessential elements are seperated using 3 fidfferent types of punctuation marks.
1. Commas (,) 
2. Parentheses ()
3. Dashes (-)
Generally the punctuation is interchangeable but you must consistently use the same punctuation mark so if used it must apear before and after the nonessential element. 


## How to identify supplemental questions
- if they remove commas but not conjunctions it indicates that its testing supplements instead of [[Linking clauses]].
- if the choices use different types of punctuation like commas and dashes.

## Top tips
- Make sure that both sides of the nonessential element include punctuation as this is common trick used only placing the punctuation on one side.
- Don't worry about the difference between commas dashes and parentheses as the differences in these elements isn't tested for on the SAT. 
- Don't pair semicolons or colons, this is common mistake to make but just requires you to remember that commas parentheses and dashes are the only punctuation used with supplements.
