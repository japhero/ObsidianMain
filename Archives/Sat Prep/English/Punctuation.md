- Uses
	- commas 
	- semicolons
	- colons
	- Dashes
- **Commas**
	- lists
	- sperate nonessential elements -> [[Supplements]]
	- link DC to IC -> [[Linking clauses]]
	- If the comma is linking clauses, make sure it has the coordinating or subordinating conjunction it needs to do so.
	- If the comma isn't linking clauses, make sure it serves a purpose and doesn't unnecessarily interrupt some other function of the sentence.
	- They also dont separate a subject and a verb
- Semicolons
	- IC to IC (no [[English Concept definitons#Conjunction|Conjunction]])
	- Unless it appears in a list, a semicolon must have an independent clause both before and after it. If you think a semicolon might be right, check to make sure you have an independent clause on either side. If you don't, **you can't use a semicolon.**
- **Colons**
	- Explanations and extra information
		- Many upstart tech companies fail for the same **reason: a lack** of market need for their product.
	- A colon can only appear at the end of an independent clause. If you think a colon might be right, check to make sure what comes before is a complete independent clause. If it's not, **you can't use a colon.**
- **Dashes**
	- only for [[Supplements#Nonessential Elements|Nonessential elements]]
- **Question ID**
	-  choices add/remove punctuation
	- use different punctuation
