# Adjective
An adjective is a word that expresses and attribute and  "[qualifies](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/glossary-grammatical-terms/?tl=true)" a [[#Noun]] or its subcategory's such as [[#Pronouns]]. In other words it describes a noun more fully and aptly. 

---
&emsp;
# Adverb
An adverb is a word that changes the meaning of a verb, adjective, other adverbs or a whole sentence/[[#Clause]]. It usually changes sentences that express how something is done. Additionally, Adverbs are often formed from adjectives by adding suffixes for example _nicely_ (from _nice_) or _angrily_ (from _angry_). Although this isn't concrete as some adverbs can have the same form as the corresponding [[#Adjective]] such as "she drives _fast_." where fast is an [[#Adverb]].


**Examples**
- "he _spoke_ quietly"
- "she is _very_ clever"


---
&emsp;
# Antecedent
the noun a pronoun is standing in for

**Examples** (==antecedent==, ***subject***)
- "The ***record playe**r* largely fell out of style in the 1980s and 90s, but there has since been a revival in ==its== popularity."

&emsp;
# Conjunction
**A conjunction is a word that is used to connect other words, phrases, clauses, or sentences.**  Some common conjunctions include _And_, _but_, _or_, _if_, _when_, _although_, _because_, and _unless_.

## Compound Conjunctions
Compound Conjunctions are conjunctions that use more than one word in connecting the corresponding clauses together.

&emsp;

# Clause
A [[#Clause]] is a grammatical unit or container that contains a [[#Verb]] or [[#Verb phrase]]. It can be a complete sentence by itself and can also form parts of a sentence.

**Example**
- the sentence ‘I like folk music’ consists of one clause, while the sentence ‘I like folk music, but I’m not keen on jazz’ consists of two clauses linked by _but_.

## Dependent vs Independent clauses
The main difference between a dependent clause and an independent clause is whether the clause can stand on its own as a distinct sentence. Although independent clauses don't always have to be a by themselves, they only have to be independent. Note that Dependent clauses are often called subordinate clauses.

**Examples**
The _italicized_ clauses in the following are subordinate clauses and everything **bolded** is a Main clause
- Subordinate clauses/Dependent clause
	- _After we had lunch_ we went back to work.
	-  I am glad _that you came._
	-  He sat in the garden, _reading the paper._
	- _If you see anything suspicious_, report it to the police.
- Independent clause/Main clause
	- After we had lunch, **we went back to work.**
	- **I am glad** that you came.
	- **He sat in the garden**, reading the paper.
	- If you see anything suspicious, **report it to the police.**

# Grammatical Agreement 
Agreement is when 2 elements in a [[#Clause]] have the same grammatical [person](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/glossary-grammatical-terms/?tl=true#person), [number](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/glossary-grammatical-terms/?tl=true#number), [gender](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/glossary-grammatical-terms/?tl=true#gender), or [case](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/glossary-grammatical-terms/?tl=true#case). Note that in English the main type of agreement happens between the subject and the verb of the [[#Clause]].

# Modifier
Modifiers are words, phrases, and clauses that affect and often enhance the meaning of a sentence. Modifiers offer detail that can make a sentence more engaging, clearer, or specific. The simplest form of a modifier would be an adjective or adverb. But again, modifiers can come in the form of phrases and clauses that act like adjectives and adverbs. 

Note that modifiers 

**Examples**
- "My sister, **who is an engineer**, works next door."
	- In this sentence "who is an engineer" is the modifier as it expands on the subject sister

# Noun
A **noun** is a word which can function as the [[#Subject]] or [[#Object]] of a [[#Verb]], or as the [[#Object|object]] of a [[#Preposition]] , and which typically denotes a person, place, or thing.


**Example**
- "tomato"
- "happiness"
- "London"
- "manager"
## Singular vs Plural Nouns
**Singular nouns** referred to **one** person, thing or to people or things regarded as a unit while **plural nouns** refer to **more** than one person, thing or group.


**Example**
- "table" vs "tables"
- "child" vs "children"
- "family" vs "families"

# Number of a word
Words agreeing in number means that they have [[#Grammatical Agreement]] in whether or not they are plural or singular. The reason its called agreeing in number is because of the nature of singular and plural as singular would encompass 1 subject while a plural word can encompass any other number things.

# Object

# Pronouns
**A pronoun is a word which functions like a [[#Noun|noun]] and refers to something or someone mentioned elsewhere in the discourse**. Pronouns often are inferred through the context in which they are said.

**Examples**
- in "Michael took the children with him", the pronoun him refers back to the noun Michael
- If a person in a shop points to a pair of shoes and says ‘I’d like those’, it is clear that the pronoun _I_ refers to the speaker and the pronoun _those_ refers to the shoe.

# Proper Noun
A **proper noun** (or **proper name**) is a name used for an individual person, animal, organization, title, place etc. Proper names are usually capitalized. Note that Proper name is sometimes used irrespective of the amount of nouns or noun phrases that it contains, while proper noun is sometimes used when there is a single noun.


**Examples**
- _Richard_
- _Germany_
- _July_
- _United States_ (of _America_)

&emsp;

# Preposition
Prepositions on a broad level establish a relationship between things, most common of which establish when where or how things relate. For example saying that second place comes _before_ 1st place else establish a relationship between those 2 objects relative to their place in some arbitrary ranking. It's important to note that the word **before** establishes that relationship and is therefore a preposition. Another example is Paul is _from_ Germany in this case the word **from** establishes that relationship and is therefore a preposition. Prepositions don't necessarily have to be about things in time or space but again simply have to establish a relationship. Eg the author _wrote_ the book, Tell me _about_ yourself.

# Subject 
The subject of a sentence or [clause](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/glossary-grammatical-terms/?tl=true#clause) is the part which:

- is usually what the sentence or clause is about
- often denotes the person or thing that performs the action expressed by the verb
- usually comes before the verb
- agrees grammatically with the verb.

The subject is usually a [[#Noun]], [[#noun phrase]], or [[#Pronouns|pronoun]].

In each of the following example sentences, the subject is italicized:
- _All the men_ arrived late.
- A few years ago, _Susan_ was given an award.
- _It_ is raining.
