#boundries_question
Linking Clauses questions are questions that ask how to connect different phrases together. Practically this means identifying what the "surrounding" are and then applying the correct rule. The application of the rule depends on if the sentence is a [[English Concept definitons#Dependent vs Independent clauses|dependent or an independent clause]] and therefore that is what you must qualify.

### Coordination  ![|right|200](https://i.imgur.com/hnoQLoz.png)
(independent + independent)
Coordination is again the act of connecting 2 independent clauses. You can connect independent clauses using 2 methods.
1. Use a comma and then add a coordinating conjunction or [[English Concept definitons#FANBOYS|FANBOYS]].
2. Use a semicolon (;)

Failing to use a comma after a coordinating conjunction is a common mistake and is called a comma splice.

### Subordination
(independent + Dependent)
Subordination uses subordinating conjunctions which are words that turn a independent clause into a dependent one, some of these words might include although, since, because while and after. When placing subordinate conjunctions you are only required to have a comma and the conjunction the order depends on where the main clause is, as again if the main clause comes before the dependent clause you generally dont use a comma. 


**Example:** "She continued working although she was tired."
- no comma required

**Example:** "Although she was tired, she continued working."
- comma comes after the clause 


&emsp;
### Ending punctuation

Ending punctuation has 2 rules

> [!INFO]- **1.** The punctuation must match the function of the sentence.
>  This means that the sentence cant function differently from the punctuation, for example it wouldn't make sense for me to say "Your bike looks nice?" because I'm not asking a question so i don't need a question mark. 

> [!info]- **2.** End punctuation can only be used to separate two independent clauses.
> This rule is pretty straight forward punctuation can only separate distinct sentences. 


### Tips and strategy

- Remember that independent clauses do not start with subordinate conjunctions so if a phrase starts with a subordinate clause it is a dependant sentence. 
- Semicolons can be used to link two independent clauses without any conjunction.
