- Mc essay is an essy thats not genuine 
- Make sure to show not tell
- Essays that are very good at describing things are effective.
	- "she opens with a sound , that coughing, and then creates a visual scene that we can see clearly." using emotions isnt cliche its just how you implement them.
- "He or she is more concerned about demonstrating the ability to be abstract then the ability to be precise."
- precision is power.
