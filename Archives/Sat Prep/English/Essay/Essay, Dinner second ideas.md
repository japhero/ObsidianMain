It tasted kinov dry as i swallow it, my dinner haven't "gelungen" me as my mom would say 
> Fix transition

### idea 1
 People have always told me that conflict doesn't belong at the table, well my i dont think my family got that memo as sometimes the table felt like a newsroom the long wood table now made out of steel a cold crisp mic in my hand i yammered on, only these words weren't about the wildfires in California or the weather in DC it was about the war in Ukraine or even my next engineering project the topic was never constant yet always focused. 

&emsp;
### idea 2
Talking with my Mom about her work talking with my Dad about his hobbies talking to my brothers made me

&emsp;
### idea 3
Some people are wrong, its a fact weather its the reporter with the dark blue tie or your smug brother at the other end of the table 


&emsp;
### idea 4
Wrong I shouted the room eerily quiet after i had done so, the long shadow of my brothers face wincing at the sound of my voice clearly frustrated, at this point in the conversation we had both stopped caring about who was right, only really trying to convince ourselves that the other was wrong. I probably would have told you that $1+1 =3$ had it meant that I was considered the winner, a kind of Olympic gold medal for stubbornness. 

I had always been an argumentative kid weather that meant arguing about politics or who should clean the dishes it didn't really matter to me as I often to  my own fault wanted to argue.  Lengths of this ritual although made me realize that there was always the brother who didn't want to clean the dishes, always the other side. Being able to understand why my brother might not want to clean the dishes is a skill declining in use and in a world where our perspective is shaped by bytes and bits there isn't even enough time to think about perspectives anymore.

When my english teacher asks me what Salinger meant in catcher in the rye or when my government teacher asks why we should have the right to free speech I hope to answer not because I know im right but because I want to find out and although i might sometimes be stubborn I hope that sometimes i might get close 

In the future i hope to expand my focus group and i hope that they will continue to allow me to challenge what i believe and to minimize my bias. 



did the founding fathers really want everyone to own a gun?  

These aren't questions these are opinions waiting to happen and 

We have the right to free speech use it.
