It was loud, really loud nevertheless i didn't have any time to waste being almost 7000 kilometers away from home i couldn't waste a second no matter how loud my eating partners were. Bighting down on my food i thought although this isn't bratwurst i must be german now.

Having moved to America with 18 months the food in my mouth and the noise in my ear was foreign. 



It had way too much fat on it but i didn't care kind of like eating a burger it just tastes good. The food item in question was a pigs knuckle or translated Schweinshaxe the brown looking delicacy infront of me was exactly as you would expect a slightly oval shaped mass of fat and muscle pretruding was a thick crisp layer of skin, internally a soft tender core gushing with liquid and a bone sticking out it almost like a caricature of a food item like the food that i saw in the comics growing up.

Even though I moved to america at 18 months I had always thought of myself as german but now eating german food being in german city it felt very foreign like showing up to the first day of school it feels familiar but something isn't quite right. Having heard the stories isn't quite the real thing and that realization hit, I felt more like a halfbreed the kind you see in fairy tails missing 6 of my stripes and of my 25 stars. 

Eating dinner with my oma talking to her about 

I experienced my identity through proxy through other people ideas and experiences of what it was to be german because living in the land of the free made it
