<div class="_1l1MA" data-track-load="qd_description_content"><p>Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:&nbsp;<code>I</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>M</code>.</p>

<pre><strong>Symbol</strong>       <strong>Value</strong>
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000</pre>

<p>For example,&nbsp;<code>2</code> is written as <code>II</code>&nbsp;in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. <code>12</code> is written as&nbsp;<code>XII</code>, which is simply <code>X + II</code>. The number <code>27</code> is written as <code>XXVII</code>, which is <code>XX + V + II</code>.</p>

<p>Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not <code>IIII</code>. Instead, the number four is written as <code>IV</code>. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as <code>IX</code>. There are six instances where subtraction is used:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>I</code> can be placed before <code>V</code> (5) and <code>X</code> (10) to make 4 and 9.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><code>X</code> can be placed before <code>L</code> (50) and <code>C</code> (100) to make 40 and 90.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><code>C</code> can be placed before <code>D</code> (500) and <code>M</code> (1000) to make 400 and 900.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> num = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> "III"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 3 is represented as 3 ones.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> num = 58
<strong>Output:</strong> "LVIII"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> num = 1994
<strong>Output:</strong> "MCMXCIV"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

# My solution 
This is the first solution where i didn't need that much help from the outside, I got part of it from the outside but not really il explain.

## Initial Approach 
Originally I saw a video online explaining that problems should be solved in the way that our brains comprehend the problem. This leads me to think about how the numerals are structured. In the description, we can see that all the letters that are added are greater than the previous letters. That means we can go through each letter and if the next letter is less than the current letter we can add them, but if the inverse is true we subtract. 

## Approach in Code

``` python
def romanToInt(s: str) -> int:
    letterHash = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100,'D':500,'M':1000}
    lastLetter = 1
    total = 0
    
    for l in list(s[::-1]):
        
        currLetter = letterHash[l]
        
        if currLetter >= lastLetter:
            total += currLetter
            
        else:
            total -= currLetter
        lastLetter = currLetter 
        
    return total

print(romanToInt("MCMXCIV"))
print(romanToInt("XC"))
print(romanToInt("IV"))
```
We will start off by saying that this is using a hash map structure and a hash was the main way to extract numeric values out of the system efficiently.

```python
for l in list(s[::-1]):
	pass
```
This is the main difference between the approach and the solution. This code simply flips the list to just be inverse example:  <span style ="color:#8b6bee"> [X,V,I] -> [I,V,X] </span>. This is easier as comparing the "next" value is more complicated than flipping the entire thing and just inverting the math so that when the old value is greater than the current value we add the current value to the total but when the current value is greater than the old value we subtract.
