You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `matrix` _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat.jpg)

**Input:** matrix = ((1,3,5,7),(10,11,16,20),(23,30,34,60)), target = 3
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat2.jpg)

**Input:** matrix = ((1,3,5,7),(10,11,16,20),(23,30,34,60)), target = 13
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix(i).length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-104 <= matrix(i)(j), target <= 104`

# Solution
Used [[Binary search]] 

## Formula Explanation 
The hardest part of using [[Binary search]] is indexing as the normal [[Binary search]] uses a linear list. We can continue to use the linear list if we can still value of the index from the matrix that's why the goal of our formula is to find 2 numbers:
1. The row number of the **Index**.
2. The **index** of the **Index** inside of its row.
We need to find these numbers because that is how we find the actual value of the current index. **The formula should take an index and return its value in the matrix.**

### Finding the Collum and Row number.
To find the Collum and Row number we will use the amount of Collums and the current target index to evaluate them. We use the Collum amount because we want to ask the question **what's my row number.** Logically if you divide the current index by the Collum number the whole number represents the row number and the decimal value indicates what position we are at in that row.

As show in the graphic we used $\mod {}$ and $floor$ to separate the decimal  into the remainder and whole number.
