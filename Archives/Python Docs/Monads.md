- Functor is a value and a mechanism to do somthing with the value. Would that be like the `@property` [[Dunder Methods|Dunder Method]] 

## Functor 
- Returns a new functor with a new functor
- Mechanism for doing somthing 
- Encapsulates
- `map()` in [[Python (index)|python]] is an example

## Endofunctors 
- similar to Functor but has the same shape 
```python
def add_one(x:int) -> int:
	return x + 1
```
- We care about the structure that the functor value is applied to not the actual value like add one we dont care if we are adding $9 +1$ or $2+1$ we care about what we did with 9 and the 8.
